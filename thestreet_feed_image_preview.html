<p>Shareholders have called Elon Musk&#x27;s focus into question in the past, so Tesla, one of a handful of companies Musk leads, has devised a trillion-dollar plan to keep Musk engaged.</p>
<p>Tesla has proposed the biggest pay package in modern history, which could potentially pay Musk an unprecedented $1 trillion if he reaches some serious benchmarks.</p>
<p>The company believes this carrot will help Musk turn his attention back to building Tesla, and away from things that have nothing to do with his business, like politics and online trolling.</p>
<p>While investors won&#x27;t vote on this proposal until the company&#x27;s November 6 annual shareholder meeting, the strategy has not worked in the short-term.  Musk still spends a lot of time tweeting far-right conspiracy theories and propaganda to his millions of loyal followers.</p>
<p>While Musk claims he has more than enough bandwidth to troll online while also running Tesla, SpaceX, X, xAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and other ventures, one government official says one of his most valuable companies is already dropping the ball.</p>

<p>NASA has had a very fruitful relationship with SpaceX, but on Oct. 20, acting chief Sean Duffy said he is growing so frustrated with the company that NASA could start looking for alternative contractors.</p>
<p>Duffy told CNBC that SpaceX is behind schedule on its commitment to build the lunar lander that astronauts would take to the moon as part of its $2.9 billion contract with the government. He said NASA may soon seek a different partner if the company doesn&#x27;t get its act together.</p>
<p>&quot;They push their timelines out, and we&#x27;re in a race against China,&quot; Duffy told CNBC. &quot;So, I&#x27;m going to open up the contract. I&#x27;m going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX.&quot;</p>
<p>SpaceX signed the nearly $3 billion government contract in 2021. It helped solidify the fledgling company as a powerhouse in space travel as the country with the most advanced space program gave it the stamp of approval.</p>
<p>Since then, SpaceX&#x27;s valuation has ballooned from $100 billion to reports of over $400 billion.</p>
<p>But it has recently run into trouble as Starship, the vessel that will lead NASA&#x27;s lunar push, blew up in flight three times this year, although it&#x27;s also had a few successful suborbital flight tests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this isn&#x27;t the first time Duffy has called out Elon Musk this year.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump handpicked Sean Duffy to lead the Department of Transportation. Since Duffy took the job, the president in July also promoted him to serve as acting administrator of NASA.</p>
<p>Duffy has butted heads with Musk over cuts the Department of Government Efficiency tried to make at the Department of Transportation, the government agency tasked with regulating electric vehicle maker Tesla, among other responsibilities.</p>
<p>Apparently, Musk wanted Duffy to fire air traffic controllers at a time when the DOT is facing staffing issues.</p>
<p>&quot;Safety-critical positions are not going to be fired within the Department of Transportation. We can do things more efficiently ... but we are not going to fire air controllers,&quot; Duffy said earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Elon - or no one else - is the Secretary. I am. The Senate confirmed me.&quot;</p>

<p>The backyard shindig isn&#x27;t just for summer. In fact, considering how oppressive summer heat is these days, there are few parties that hit as well as the autumn evening get-together. Crisp fall breezes, roaring fire pits, and, if you&#x27;re lucky, tasty cocktails being whipped up by the host. If you plan on entertaining in fall, winter, or any season, you&#x27;ll need the right bar table that&#x27;s sturdy enough to hold drinks, snacks, and perhaps an entire buffet.</p>
<p>Right now, Walmart is selling the attractive and surprisingly roomy Ktaxon Outdoor Wicker Bar Table for just $95 with one of its limited-time Flash sales. It normally goes for $130, but you can save $35 if you add this lovely piece of outdoor furniture to your cart right now. Shoppers love it, calling it &quot;durable, functional, and quick to assemble.&quot; What more could you ask for in a piece of outdoor furniture?</p>
<p>When purchasing furniture for decks, patios, and backyards, people usually default to the standard tables and chairs, with something offbeat like hammocks occasionally thrown in. However, when adorning an outdoor space, sometimes it helps to consider indoor furniture, especially when it comes to entertaining.</p>
<p>This wicker bar table is just like a mini bar you might have inside, only it&#x27;s made for outside use. Shoppers love how versatile this table is, especially when it comes to entertaining.</p>
<p>&quot;We can either use it to spread out snacks or fun summer outdoor drinks, depending on the company,&quot; one shopper said. &quot;The covered shelves actually prevent rain from soaking our paper plates and plastic silverware.&quot;</p>
<p>With two layers of storage just under the table, you can perpetually house everything, including bottles of rum, mugs, dessert plates, those little cocktail umbrellas, party hats, or even a book or two for when you want to lounge outside on cozy days. And while there&#x27;s room for highball and martini glasses, there are dedicated racks just under the tabletop for wine glasses.</p>
<p>Despite being rather low profile, the tabletop is surprisingly roomy at 54 inches long. There&#x27;s plenty of room to mix drinks, lay out rows of snacks, or even a couple of diners, as long as they don&#x27;t mind eating standing up. Outdoor parties are casual that way.</p>
<p>This table will require some assembly, but it&#x27;s relatively easy and quick, according to reviewers. Another point in the win column for this wicker bar is how unbelievably durable it is. One shopper claimed that a tree fell on their bar table, and while scuffed, it was still standing upright and ready to be used.</p>
<p>If you do a lot of backyard entertaining, you need the Ktaxon Outdoor Wicker Bar Table in your life. It retails for $130, but you can shop it at Walmart right now for just $95 with this limited-time Flash sale.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Hotel subscriptions are becoming popular but are they worth it</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/travel/hotel-subscriptions-are-becoming-popular-but-are-they-worth-it'>Original</a> — 2190 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/thestreet_f268ef2f4cec.png'></p>
<p>With industries like airlines to chain restaurants now selling subscriptions to their regular customers, hotels have become the latest to enter this space with membership programs in which one can pay a monthly or annual fee to get access to anything from late check out and automatic upgrades to set prices for booked nights.</p>
<p>The latest hotel giant to launch a paid membership program is Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts. Expanding the regular loyalty program known as Wyndham Rewards, the New Jersey-based giant between 9,200 hotels globally has announced the Wyndham Rewards Insider for those who want to shell out $95 a year for additional perks.</p>
<p>These include 10% off standard rates at Wyndham properties around the world, an automatic boost to the Gold loyalty status that would otherwise be reached after five nights at a qualifying property and discounts of between 5% and 10% on flights, vacation packages, cars, tours and concert and other activity tickets booked through the chain&#x27;s various travel and transportation partnerships.</p>
<p>&quot;The world of travel rewards is changing,&quot; Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts Chief Commercial Officer Scott Strickland said in a statement. &quot;[...] Historically, such benefits were reserved only for the travel elite, off-limits to those without high-fee, premium credit cards. Wyndham Rewards Insider flips that script, putting the power back in the hands of everyday travelers - all for less than the cost of a night out.&quot;</p>
<p>As such hotel subscriptions become more common and increasingly start to get adopted by bigger chains, several industry analysts have weighed in on whether they are worth it or will become yet another subscription that one signs up for and forgets about until the charge reappears on one&#x27;s credit card.</p>
<p>In general, hotel subscriptions can still be useful to travelers who do not spend enough to accrue status since they can translate into an immediate discount or free night through the sign-up points bonus but will only be maximized for those who travel regularly and consistently stay with the same brand. Without the sign-up bonus, the discount offered immediately at sign-up will usually not be enough to make up for the annual fee.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Amazon and Chewy just got a major vote of confidence: Here’s why</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/economy/amazon-and-chewy-just-got-a-major-vote-of-confidence-heres-why'>Original</a> — 3965 chars</p>

<p>Online shopping isn&#x27;t just coming back; it&#x27;s growing smarter, quicker, and more customized.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not simply improved technology that leads to growth; it&#x27;s also deeper integration. AI is beginning to make online stores more personal in real time, while fulfillment robots and drone deliveries are making it easier to get things right away.</p>
<p>As Bank of America analysts wrote:</p>
<p>AI-driven shopping experiences will continue to get better.</p>
<p>With that in mind, certain prominent companies, including Amazon and Chewy, may be more prepared than others to ride the next wave.</p>
<p>The digital shopping upswing is gaining steam, and AI is gradually taking over.</p>
<p>Inflation, tariffs, and the odd bankruptcy are in the news a lot lately, but there is a deeper change going on behind the scenes. Online shopping is become quicker, easier, and more intuitive than ever thanks to things like algorithmic customization, warehouse robots, and AI-generated product discovery.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not simply hype about technology. Bank of America says that worldwide eCommerce sales will reach $4.85 trillion in 2026, which is a 10% increase from 2025. That rate is far faster than the company&#x27;s prediction of 3% worldwide GDP growth, which shows how rapidly digital retail is exceeding other economic trends.</p>
<p>Growth in the U.S. is almost as great. BofA thinks the real growth rate for online gross merchandise volume is around 10% in 2025, although official data shows a lower pace. GMV is predicted to rise 9% year over year to $1.34 trillion.</p>
<p>One standout insight: &quot;Online penetration of total retail [is projected] to expand 100bps y/y to 17.5% in 2026.&quot; If that happens, it would mark a key recovery milestone - and possibly the start of a new AI-led phase in how Americans shop.</p>
<p>A major tailwind is the expected launch of Agentic AI shopping, which lets smart bots not only suggest items but also make purchases depending on user objectives, preferences, or budgets. That change might make the purchase process more faster and push people even more toward digital.</p>
<p>Not all eCommerce stocks are the same, but Bank of America thinks two of them, Amazon and Chewy, are the best ones to buy before 2026.</p>
<p>Amazon is still the best large-cap stock, since it is the leader in both digital retail and cloud infrastructure. Analysts point out that Amazon is growing its food business, using robots to improve its margins while using Prime to develop a strong position in Agentic AI purchasing.</p>
<p>That provides the corporation an advantage in terms of structure as AI starts to play a bigger part in how people shop.</p>
<p>But Amazon isn&#x27;t the only name well positioned.</p>
<p>Chewy, which has long been considered as a niche pet player, is now becoming a high-upside SMID cap.</p>
<p>BofA likes the firm because it might gain market share, increase profits via automation, and avoid some of the problems that other retailers are seeing in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Chewy hasn&#x27;t only depended on the pandemic to help it grow, as a lot of mid-caps have. Instead, it&#x27;s developing a strong moat with returning customers and good logistics.</p>
<p>The analyst note also shows that the market is split. BofA&#x27;s U.S. eCommerce coverage is trading at roughly 2.7 times projected EV/sales.</p>
<p>However, this average belies a big difference: Large caps are up 37% this year, while SMID companies are down 7%. That difference shows there may be selective chances and potential upside in stocks like Chewy if the mood changes.</p>
<p>The internet shopping experience is about to see big changes, from Agentic AI to drone delivery. There are still significant threats like tariffs and inflation, but the move toward online buying isn&#x27;t over yet.</p>
<p>As more and more stores use automation and AI to personalize shopping experiences, businesses with the proper tech stack and dedicated customers may have the upper hand.</p>
<p>The lesson for investors is clear: in a $4.85 trillion eCommerce sector, it&#x27;s more important than ever to select the right names.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>AT&amp;T sends harsh warning to customers</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/retail/att-sends-harsh-warning-to-customers'>Original</a> — 3936 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/thestreet_72bc33bf6f31.jpg'></p>
<p>AT&amp;T (T) and other rival phone carriers are currently benefiting from a major shift in customer behavior that is boosting their profits.</p>
<p>Consumers nationwide are cutting the cord on traditional internet services provided by cable companies such as Comcast and Spectrum as prices go up.</p>
<p>As an alternative, many consumers are switching to fixed wireless internet services, which are cheaper than traditional internet provided by cable companies. Phone carriers including AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile offer fixed wireless internet, also known as 5G home internet.</p>
<p>&quot;Although 5G home internet technically isn&#x27;t faster than cable or fiber internet, it offers a lot of value,&quot; said Peter Holslin, managing editor at Reviews.org, in the survey. &quot;5G internet packages are typically sold at fixed rates, with no extra fees for installation or equipment, and you often get other perks too like unlimited data and bundle discounts when you pair it with a cell phone plan from the same provider.&quot;</p>
<p>A recent survey from Cord Cutters News revealed that only 40.2% of consumers now rely on cable TV companies for their internet service, a significant decrease from 45% in late 2024. Also, roughly 11% rely on 5G home internet, up from 8.4% just a year ago.</p>
<p>Amid this growing trend, AT&amp;T welcomed 203,000 new AT&amp;T Internet Air (5G home internet) customers during the second quarter of this year. It also gained 243,000 new fiber internet customers.</p>
<p>Customers with bundled packages that include internet, TV, or phone services will also see the internet portion of their bill increase by $5.</p>
<p>&quot;To ensure we continue providing the quality service and support you deserve, the price of your home internet plan will increase by $5/month, starting December 1, 2025,&quot; said AT&amp;T in an email to customers.</p>
<p>In a statement to TheVerge, an AT&amp;T spokesperson said the company is increasing the prices of its internet services due to &quot;increasing operational costs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As we work to meet the evolving needs of our business and manage increasing operational costs, we&#x27;re adjusting our internet plan rates to help maintain the high-quality service our customers expect,&quot; said the AT&amp;T spokesperson. &quot;We&#x27;re committed to keeping customers informed about these updates and their choices. To help offset these changes, customers who have not already enrolled in Autopay and Paperless Billing can receive a $10 monthly discount by enrolling with an eligible bank account, or a $5 discount with a debit card. Customers can review all details regarding their plan and associated fees on their monthly statements or by visiting att.com.&quot;</p>
<p>The move from AT&amp;T comes after it increased its internet prices by $5 in November last year. Some AT&amp;T fiber internet customers also faced a $5 increase in 2023.</p>
<p>In April this year, the company also reduced its monthly discount for autopay and paperless billing. Internet customers who pay their monthly bill with a debit card saw their discount shrink from $10 to $5, and customers who pay their bill with a credit card had their autopay and paperless billing discount completely removed.</p>
<p>Many AT&amp;T internet customers took to the social media platform Reddit to express frustration with the latest round of price increases. Some claimed that the internet service wasn&#x27;t worth the higher price due to recent outages.</p>
<p>&quot;You guys don&#x27;t even have stability right now and have gone out 3x in the past 3 months and you want us to pay more? You&#x27;ve lost your minds. I&#x27;m switching immediately,&quot; wrote one AT&amp;T customer in the comment section of a Reddit post discussing the price increase.</p>
<p>&quot;I received this notice the same day my home internet stopped working for 2 days straight. Feels like a slap in the face, paying even more for a service that doesn&#x27;t work when you need it,&quot; wrote another customer.</p>
<p>&quot;ATT advertised the price was not just an intro rate like other providers. I&#x27;m pissed about another price increase,&quot; claimed another.</p>

<p>Tracking mud inside your entryway or shaking snow off your boots all over your kitchen floor makes a giant, slippery mess. Cute welcome mats have their time and place, but to get through rainy fall and spring seasons and handle snowy winters, a heavy-duty doormat that absorbs water and keeps dirt outside where it belongs can save you from having to clean up after every trip outside. One of Amazon&#x27;s top-rated waterproof doormats is on sale at an absolute steal right now, and it&#x27;s an outstanding choice for anyone who needs an affordable solution for dealing with slippery floors at home.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014 by two working moms and pet owners who wanted durable and strong home essentials that still looked nice, Gorilla Grip products are a fan favorite of homeowners. All of the brand&#x27;s products undergo rigorous testing to ensure high-quality and safety standards are met, and this waterproof indoor outdoor rug is no exception.</p>
<p>This mat&#x27;s all-weather construction includes a stain-, weather-, and fade-resistant topside woven from synthetic fibers, paired with a durable natural rubber backing that provides higher tensile strength and tear resistance than standard doormats. Deep grooves in a diamond-shaped pattern and a beveled rubber border capture mud, dirt, sand, and moisture, while the textured surface traps debris before it tracks inside.</p>
<p>A low-profile design allows doors to close over this mat without catching, so it&#x27;s versatile for indoor use, too - like under your dog&#x27;s water bowl or in a mudroom. Unlike thin mats that shred or slide, this doormat&#x27;s retention dam prevents water pooling, and the non-slip backing grips hardwood, tile, or carpet. It&#x27;s a particularly useful choice for high-traffic areas like entryways or kitchens where pets or kids might bring in snow, sand, or grass clippings.</p>
<p>With nearly 5,000 five-star reviews on Amazon and an average rating of 4.4 out of five stars, this rug is one of the retailer&#x27;s top-rated weatherproof doormats. Shoppers are particularly impressed with this mat&#x27;s ability to hold up in high-traffic areas without slipping or shredding.&quot;I love this mat. It stays in place, is durable, and works great,&quot; a satisfied shopper shared. One pet owner commented that the mat &quot;stops people and pets from bringing the outside inside.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Cybersecurity expert offers blunt verdict on AWS outage</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/technology/cybersecurity-expert-offers-blunt-verdict-on-aws-outage'>Original</a> — 3997 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/thestreet_d1fad1cc95a0.jpg'></p>
<p>For what felt like forever on Monday, Oct. 21, the internet&#x27;s pulse flatlined.</p>
<p>Food-delivery apps froze, Fortnite gamers got booted mid-battle, and Venmo payments disappeared mid-transfer. Most would have guessed a massive cyberattack or hack, but it turned out to be something far more ordinary and perhaps more alarming: a bad day inside Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>The glitch started in AWS&#x27;s US-EAST-1 regionin Northern Virginia, where a subsystem fault monitoring network load balancers spiraled into a massive outage.</p>
<p>The result was global chaos across thousands of platforms, from Snapchat and Reddit to Zoom, Coinbase, and even government services.</p>
<p>Downdetector reports millions of problem reports came in at the peak, with analysts pegging the number of affected businesses at more than 1,000. However, investors largely shrugged it off, with Amazon stock ending higher as service slowly returned.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s important to note that AWS is essentially the quiet engine keeping the digital world afloat.</p>
<p>With a 30% market share in cloud infrastructure, it races ahead of its competition in Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, anchoring a $100 billion-a-quarter industry. For more color, AWS generated a whopping$10.2 billion in operating income in the previous quarter, with more than 50% of Amazon&#x27;s total $19.2 billion.</p>
<p>In making sense of all the hullabaloo, cybersecurity expert David Kennedy just dropped a curt and pertinent take on the AWS outage.</p>
<p>Kennedy is the founder ofTrustedSec and a career offensive-security operator who has led red-team hunts for Fortune 500s along with several public agencies. Additionally, he&#x27;s a former Marine and co-founded Binary Defense, developing widely used open-source pen-testing tools while helping to organize major industry conferences.</p>

<p>AWS blinked this week, and much of the internet bore the brunt of it.</p>
<p>From crypto exchanges to banks, entire operations went quiet, and that&#x27;s exactly what TrustedSec founder David Kennedy says is a wake-up call for every business that&#x27;s betting big on the cloud.</p>
<p>&quot;This wasn&#x27;t a hack,&quot; Kennedy told CNBC&#x27;s The Exchange. &quot;But it shows how fragile our infrastructure is.&quot; He further went on to say that something as simplistic as &quot;a small DNS change&quot; could ripple across critical systems.</p>
<p>Kennedy noted that AWS has had multiple outages in the past as well, and warned that redundancy remains the weak point.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully Amazon&#x27;s looking at this and saying, can we roll over to another data center so we don&#x27;t see these massive outages?&quot;</p>
<p>Beyond Amazon, Kennedy feels the core of the problem stretches across the tech ecosystem. &quot;Everything from Coinbase to government installations went down,&quot; he said. &quot;When one data center fails, it cascades.&quot;</p>
<p>He also sounded the alarm on the growing convergence of IT and operational technology, including everything from utilities to financial systems, as a potential flashpoint.</p>
<p>This wasn&#x27;t the first AWS disruption, and the list below, covering the biggest ones in the past five years, is proof that even the world&#x27;s most reliable cloud has vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Oct. 20, 2025: US-EAST-1 (global ripple)</p>
<p>The hack lasted for roughly 15 hours, linked to an internal fault tied to network load balancers in AWS&#x27;s largest region, which froze services such as Snapchat, Reddit, Venmo, Alexa, and Fortnite.</p>
<p>A capacity-management subsystem error knocked out over 100 AWS services, including ones like Lambda and API Gateway. The two-hour disruption led to broad app timeouts across customer workloads.</p>
<p>Control-plane network device issues led to major slowdowns in arguably AWS&#x27;s busiest zone, which impacted streaming, e-commerce, and collaboration platforms.</p>
<p>A critical network traffic engineering hiccup led to a relatively brief but comprehensive global breakdown impacting services such as Twitch, Netflix, and Slack.</p>
<p>An Amazon Kinesis meltdown resulted in all-day disruptions ripping across third-party apps and financial websites.</p>

<p>If dropping temperatures and the late-October festivities have you thinking ahead to colder holidays and winter nights to come, you may want to start putting away your summer wardrobe or storing some of your summertime bedding and decor. And when you find yourself running out of space in the closet, kitchen, laundry room, basement, garage, or foyer, what&#x27;s left for storage but under the bed?</p>
<p>Right now, Walmart has a fantastic Flash Deal on a two-pack of Under-Bed Storage Containers with Wheels, which can help you get organized and store your warm-weather clothing safely and out of sight. Normally priced at $63, you can get them for just $30 - or $33 off.</p>
<p>Reviewers call these &quot;great products,&quot; saying they&#x27;re spacious, easy to put together, and sturdily made. They&#x27;ve got wheels on the bottom for easy access, and they&#x27;re plenty versatile, with high-density waterproof materials, but you&#x27;ll want to be careful not to overstuff them. They&#x27;re ideal for excess clothing, unused bedding, plushies, and other soft odds and ends.</p>
<p>&quot;These storage organizers were easy to assemble, and they&#x27;re quite roomy,&quot; said one reviewer. &quot;They&#x27;re as sturdy as I expected, and tucking them under the bed is as nice and easy as can be. I also love that the cover zips on so well, keeping out dust, so that when a blanket or jacket is needed, you can just pull it out and it&#x27;s ready for use.&quot;</p>
<p>Measuring about 31 by 17 inches, with a height of 6.7 inches, these sturdy under-bed storage bins sit on a set of smooth-rolling wheels and offer quick, convenient access to the things you may not need all that often but don&#x27;t want to throw out. The covering is fully transparent, so you can see which organizer you&#x27;re after before you open the whole thing up, and the whole bin is dustproof, so your off-season clothing, unused bedding, or collectibles won&#x27;t end up soiled just by sitting under the furniture.</p>
<p>Metal piping lends each container long-term durability, and the lid offers plenty of protection as well, provided you don&#x27;t fill the containers with more than they&#x27;re meant to handle. Each of the four wheels on the underside is on a 360-degree swivel, and two of them are equipped with a handy locking mechanism, in case you want to be sure the bins don&#x27;t go rolling across the room. These are available in both black and gray options, and you&#x27;ll pay the same price no matter which color you choose.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>43-year-old grocery chain to close stores less than a year after opening</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/retail/43-year-old-grocery-chain-to-close-stores-less-than-a-year-after-opening'>Original</a> — 2682 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/thestreet_b74d0157ecb0.jpg'></p>
<p>After 43 years since opening its first specialty grocery store in North Carolina, one business has grown into a nationwide chain. But like many retailers navigating today&#x27;s challenging environment, it has not escaped the wave of mass closures affecting the sector.</p>
<p>Less than a year after opening new locations in Naperville, Illinois, and Framingham, Massachusetts, The Fresh Market will soon permanently close both of these locations.</p>
<p>Despite these closures, the grocery chain continues to pursue expansion. The Fresh Market plans to open four new stores, two by the end of 2025 and another two in early 2026, bringing its footprint beyond the 172 stores it currently operates across 22 states.</p>
<p>While simultaneously closing and opening stores may seem contradictory, The Fresh Market sees these moves as part of a strategic reassessment of its store portfolio, aimed at aligning operations with long-term growth goals.</p>
<p>The Naperville store, located at 204 South Route 59, opened in November 2024 as The Fresh Market&#x27;s 164th location. According to a WARN notice, its closure will impact 47 employees.</p>
<p>Once the store shuts down, Illinois will be left with seven locations, but none are nearby. Most in the state are about an hour&#x27;s drive away, and the closest is over 30 minutes by car.</p>
<p>The Framingham store at 84 Worcester Road opened a month later, in December 2024, in the former Bed Bath &amp; Beyond space, which closed in 2020 before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2023.</p>
<p>These closures not only reduce The Fresh Market&#x27;s visibility in the affected areas but may also limit choices and access to essential goods for loyal customers, leading them to shop online instead.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation and a growing preference among consumers to shop online to find the cheapest deals took a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers in 2024,&quot; said Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig in a statement.</p>
<p>The Fresh Market&#x27;s closures are part of a larger trend affecting the national retail sector. Amid ongoing economic uncertainty, shifting consumer habits, and trade pressures, many retailers are downsizing or reallocating resources to more profitable areas.</p>
<p>Coresight Research projects that the number of U.S. store closures will reach 15,000 in 2025, more than double the 7,325 closures recorded in 2024.</p>
<p>Even industry giants are following a similar business move by reassessing their footprints and conducting layoffs.</p>
<p>Walmart (WMT) will close a store and pharmacy at 1900 South 314th Street in Federal Way, Washington, on October 31, affecting around 250 employees. Starbucks (SBUX) plans to cut about 900 corporate positions and reduce its North American footprint by roughly 1% in fiscal 2025.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Key wedding company files Chapter 11 bankruptcy, liquidation likely</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants/wedding-industry-chapter-11-bankruptcy-creates-huge-problems'>Original</a> — 2684 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/thestreet_2b4775e73c80.jpg'></p>
<p>It&#x27;s the nightmare of every bride and groom.</p>
<p>You book a venue for your wedding, rehearsal dinner, or some other marriage-related festivity, and the company goes out of business. That can be a mild problem, like you need a new cake at the last minute, or a major one, like literally not having a place to get married.</p>
<p>This actually happens quite a bit in the wedding business because venues, caterers, bands, and even wedding dresses are purchased so far in advance.</p>
<p>In 2023, for example, when David&#x27;s Bridal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, many brides did not know the fate of their dresses. Had the company ordered them? Would they arrive? And would there be a company location where customers could pick them up?</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s essentially this or nothing,&quot; U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christine Gravelle said when she reluctantly approved the no-cash sale to CION, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>David&#x27;s Bridal was not a unique situation, and now another vital wedding industry brand has closed down without notice, leaving couples unsure of what is happening.</p>
<p>While a rehearsal dinner is not the same as a wedding, couples (or whoever might be footing the bill) pay thousands in deposits many months in advance to secure a location.</p>
<p>Now, &quot;The St. Johns County Sheriff&#x27;s Office has launched an investigation into complaints against Chez L&#x27;Amour restaurant and its owner, Jeanetta Cebollero, after multiple couples reported losing deposits ranging from $2,500 to $3,000,&quot; reported Florida&#x27;s News 4 Jacksonville.</p>
<p>The venue closed abruptly with no explanation and no clear plan for refunds.</p>
<p>A letter obtained by News4JAX from the St. Augustine Law Group, which represents Cebollero, explained some of the problems.</p>
<p>The venue has not filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>If you are planning a wedding, there are steps you can take to protect your investment.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s important to be very meticulous in your recordkeeping.</p>
<p>&quot;Couples should also retain a copy of all promotional items (websites, brochures,  advertisements, etc.), which will help prove the misrepresentations made. Most importantly, all documents showing the financial transactions between the parties (i.e., bank records, receipts, and canceled checks) will be vital to any claim,&quot; the website added.</p>
<p>You can also buy insurance to protect your investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Wedding insurance helps protect your money if something unexpected cancels or changes your wedding plans. It covers things that happen before or on the wedding day that are out of your control. Since weddings can be costly, insurance helps keep your money safe,&quot; Central Bank shared.</p>
<p>The site shared what your policy could cover (but make sure to read it and ask questions).</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Facebook unexpectedly shuts down a major app after five years</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/technology/facebook-unexpectedly-shuts-down-a-major-app-after-five-years'>Original</a> — 2860 chars</p>

<p>Apps have become one of the most convenient ways to instantly access services and simplify everyday tasks, all while obtaining a personalized experience.</p>
<p>However, as efficient as they are, apps can also be costly to maintain, and their profitability doesn&#x27;t always justify ongoing support.</p>
<p>For this reason, Facebook has decided to discontinue one of its most popular apps after five years.</p>
<p>On the day of the official shutdown, users will receive an in-app notification. According to Facebook&#x27;s help tab, Mac users will have 60 days to continue using the Messenger desktop app before it is fully retired. After that, access will be blocked.</p>
<p>Meta encourages users to delete the app once it becomes inactive, since it will no longer be usable.</p>
<p>Once this is done, all chat history will remain accessible online.</p>
<p>The Messenger desktop app version was introduced in 2020, during the height of the Covid pandemic, to give users a more convenient way to stay connected throughout the period of social distancing.</p>
<p>At the time, Meta reported a surge in activity, with total messaging increasing more than 50% in March 2020, while voice and video calls on Messenger and WhatsApp more than doubled, especially in countries most affected by lockdowns.</p>
<p>User engagement across Meta&#x27;s platforms, including feeds and stories, also spiked as people sought to stay in touch with loved ones. However, Meta&#x27;s business faced challenges, since many of its services weren&#x27;t directly monetized by higher engagement, and ad revenue declined in regions implementing strict pandemic measures.</p>
<p>Most recently, Meta&#x27;s second-quarter earnings for fiscal 2025 revealed that total revenue increased 22% year over year, daily active users were up 6% to nearly 3.5 billion, and ad impressions rose 9%. Yet expenses also climbed, increasing 12% to $27.1 billion.</p>
<p>One fast-growing area for Meta is Artificial Intelligence (AI). The company recently launched Meta Superintelligence Labs, dedicated to developing advanced models and innovative products such as Llama 4.1 and 4.2.</p>
<p>&quot;Meta&#x27;s vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone - so that people can direct it towards what they value in their own lives. We believe this has the potential to begin an exciting new era of individual empowerment,&quot; said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in an earnings call.</p>
<p>As part of this superintelligence initiative, Meta is focusing on business messaging and AI integration, testing products in some markets that embed AI capabilities into Facebook and Instagram ads, as well as directly into e-commerce platforms.</p>
<p>While shutting down the Messenger desktop app may seem inconvenient, Meta&#x27;s decision could streamline the user experience. By consolidating messaging through the web version, users gain consistent access across desktop devices without needing to download or update separate apps.</p>

<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/markets/stock-market-today-stocks-mixed-in-futures-trading-as-defense-contractors-report'>Original</a> — 3202 chars</p>

<p>This live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market.To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here.</p>
<p>Happy Tuesday. This is TheStreet&#x27;s Stock Market Today for Oct. 21, 2025. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.</p>
<p>Silver and Gold had a fantastic Monday, but the buck -- or rather, the metal -- is stopping here.</p>
<p>The falls come after a year-long rally in the metals market, which have seen them outperform many global as investors embrace safe havens.</p>
<p>The U.S. markets are now open, with stocks trading mostly flat. The Dow (+0.09%) and S&amp;P 500 (+0.04%) are up just a few bips, while the Nasdaq (-0.05%) is declining. In small cap land, the Russell 2000 (-0.51%) is pulling back from a nearly 2% run yesterday; Gold is also erasing its fantastical gains from yesterday.</p>
<p>The company said during its Tuesday earnings that its full-year EBIT, adjusted automotive free cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share will come in higher than it forecasted at its last update.</p>
<p>Some of the savings are coming from less-steep tariff exposures, which are now seen costing the firm between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion. That&#x27;s down from $4 billion to $5 billion previously.</p>
<p>Making matters better, GM&#x27;s third quarter vehicle sales rose 8% year-over-year to 710,347; that made it the best-selling brand in America and gave it the best market share relative to the rest of the industry in eight years.</p>
<p>As aforementioned, a number of reports have already happened this morning and elicited reactions from investors. Among them are General Motors (+10.09%) and RTX Corp (+4.8%), as well as PulteGroup (-2.53%) and Northrop Grumman (-2.16%).</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the cropping of some of the largest morning reports sourced from TipRanks, which seem to be coming in mostly in line on revenue, but so-so on EPS earnings:</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also other companies making moves this morning which haven&#x27;t reported, including EPAM Systems (+3.26%) and Newmont Goldcorp (-4.57%). Per data from Investing.com, here are companies which are making big swings ahead of the opening bell today:</p>
<p>Good morning. After a strong start to the week, stocks are flat in futures trading, as a flurry of reports from defense contractors are set to define the morning trade. They won&#x27;t be alone.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what is on deck for today:</p>
<p>Rolling into midweek, data from Nasdaq says there will be 62 earnings reports today, with GE Aerospace, Coca-Cola, and Philip Morris International heading up the morning reports.</p>
<p>This evening, we&#x27;ll also get today&#x27;s biggest report in Netflix, plus some other results from Texas Instruments and Capital One Financial, among others.</p>
<p>This morning, Redbook for Oct. 18 should be out just before 9:00 a.m. ET, at which point the Fed&#x27;s Christopher Waller is expected to give remarks. Later today, at 3:30 p.m. ET, we&#x27;ll also hear from him again.</p>
<p>Aside from the NY Fed&#x27;s 1-2.5 yrs Treasury Purchase report and a refreshed on API Crude Oil Stocks throughout today, those are the largest and most significant economic data reports out today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government enters its 21st day of shutdown. Still, seemingly with no end in sight.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>This might be the worst dividend ETF in the world</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/investing/this-might-be-the-worst-dividend-etf-in-the-world'>Original</a> — 3878 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/thestreet_d7d71938d3ed.jpg'></p>
<p>Traditional dividend ETFs are designed to offer stability, regular income and long-term capital growth. Even the ones that push the limits of good faith in what it means to be a dividend ETF at least bear some resemblance to one.</p>
<p>But one ETF is the worst representation of a dividend ETF that I&#x27;ve seen.</p>
<p>While the fund&#x27;s objective says that it &quot;aims to maximize yield per unit of active risk,&quot; there&#x27;s no way that this ETF in practice could even charitably be described as a dividend strategy. It has so few guardrails on what it&#x27;s allowed to do and is clearly taking advantage of it.</p>
<p>On the surface, returns look good, the Morningstar rating is solid and it has a razor-thin expense ratio. All hallmarks of what you&#x27;d look for in a good fund.</p>
<p>Look under the hood, however, at how the sausage is made and you&#x27;ll find something ugly.</p>
<p>The fund I&#x27;m talking about is the Franklin U.S. Core Dividend Tilt Index ETF (UDIV). It tracks the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Enhanced Select Index, which is designed to deliver a portfolio of stocks with a higher dividend yield than the broader market.</p>
<p>According to Morningstar, the index is constructed using an optimization framework that aims to maximize dividend yield, improve diversification, mitigate active risk, and simplify replication.</p>
<p>That all sounds well and good. In practice, however, it&#x27;s not.</p>
<p>The methodology used by UDIV essentially boils down to this:  as long as the final portfolio produces an above average yield, anything goes. There&#x27;s no quality check. No emphasis on fundamentals. No yield requirement. No baseline dividend history. The constituents of the portfolio don&#x27;t even need to pay a dividend.</p>
<p>The end result is a portfolio that looks anything but like a dividend ETF.</p>
<p>One needs to look no further than the composition of UDIV to see how absurd it is.</p>
<p>The nearly 37% allocation to tech stocks is higher than even that of the S&amp;P 500, which is as concentrated as it&#x27;s ever been in tech stocks. The rest of the sector holdings are mostly within about 2% one way or the other of the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>But even that&#x27;s not the most egregious thing about UDIV. Check out the fund&#x27;s top 10 holdings.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s count all of the ways that UDIV&#x27;s claim of being a dividend ETF is a joke.</p>
<p>Does that sound like any kind of a dividend ETF to you?</p>
<p>Almost anything qualifies as a &quot;better&quot; dividend ETF alternative to UDIV, but here are a few that I feel are constructed the right way.</p>
<p>Setting aside its miserable recent performance, this is one of the best constructed portfolios in terms of pure dividend stock exposure.</p>
<p>It incorporates screens for dividend quality, dividend growth and high yield. It also focuses on fundamentals and optimizes the portfolio to only include those stocks with the best combination of all criteria. Its 4% yield will also please income seekers.</p>
<p>DGRW looks for companies with forward-looking dividend growth potential, not just dividend history. It considers balance sheet fundamentals, including return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) as part of its selection process.</p>
<p>It also weights the portfolio by aggregate dividends paid. That means those companies paying out the most get greater weights in the portfolio.</p>
<p>SDY is perhaps the best combination of high yield and long-term dividend growth. The fund includes only those companies with a 20+ year track record of dividend growth, but then weighs qualifying components by their dividend yield.</p>
<p>The result is a fund that pays a modestly high yield but has a composition far different than that of the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>UDIV is a mega-cap growth fund with a heavy tech tilt above all else. The dividend component is only a minor consideration.</p>
<p>If you want tech exposure like this, just invest in a tech ETF. If you want a dividend ETF, go with one that actually considers dividend growth or quality as part of its selection criteria.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Walmart is selling a &#x27;comfortable and sturdy&#x27; rocking chair patio set for $60</h2>

<p>Patio furniture is a far more personal purchase than one might initially think. How you choose to configure your home&#x27;s outdoor space is a reflection of your personality and dictates the types of experiences you wish to have there. Whether you want a sprawling sectional and seat combo for crowded get-togethers or a simple bistro set for you and your partner, there&#x27;s no better place to buy than Walmart. It has one of the largest selections of patio sets anywhere on the internet, and we found a rocking chair patio set that&#x27;s currently on sale there for an amazing price.</p>
<p>This is anything but the average patio set. It includes two comfy rocking chairs and a small bistro table. The chairs have high backs and hollow-grid rattan wicker construction. The chairs and table are made from all-weather powder-coated stainless steel. That makes them both lightweight and incredibly sturdy. The entire set can be exposed to the elements year-round with very little fading or deterioration. This set is definitely built to outlast many similar sets in the same price range.</p>
<p>The table, though small, is quite impressive in its own right. The entire table is composed of stainless steel, but also has a small rattan shelf midway down the legs. This allows for additional storage of electronic devices, books, or anything else you may wish to keep close-at-hand. The chairs have a seating dimension of 23.8  inches long by 34.8 inches wide. The chairs have a weight capacity of 250 pounds each.</p>
<p>The rockers on each chair give you the perfect amount of motion without feeling unstable. What&#x27;s more, they have anti-tip foot pads on each rocker, which keeps the chairs from going too far forward or too far back at any given time. The set is available in both a light and a dark colorway, making it a great choice for almost any outdoor decor style.</p>
<p>Walmart shoppers were very impressed with this beautiful furniture. One called it &quot;a great looking set,&quot; before adding that the chairs are &quot;comfortable and sturdy. The rocker is very smooth.&quot;</p>
<p>If you want a patio set that will change the entire look and feel of your backyard, then you should consider buying the Lausaint Home 3-Piece Rocking Chair Patio Set. You can get it at the moment for only $60, so it&#x27;s better to put one in your cart sooner rather than later. This deal could disappear any minute now.</p>

<p>Although we&#x27;re not always 100% sold on all the electronic upgrades and updates hitting the market at what feels like a constant rate, smartwatches are an accessory we can fully get behind. There&#x27;s something to be said about not always needing some piece of high-tech equipment when you&#x27;re simply running errands or working out, but smartwatches make it easier than ever to pay attention to your health without lugging around a heavy phone or iPad. And though some can cost a pretty penny, you can find the perfect smartwatch for you at our favorite retailers that does everything for a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>This affordable smartwatch gives you the capabilities of a phone right at your wrist. Designed to be compatible with both Android and iOS devices, this 1.85 inch touchscreen can access texts, make calls, track steps, play music and games, and track weather. With texts, it&#x27;s important to note that while it can receive and access them, it cannot send replies. It also acts as a camera, noise detector, stopwatch timer, language assistant, calculator, flashlight, alarm clock, and calendar. The smartwatch is also equipped with multiple sports modes and fitness trackers, so you can track your workouts including running, cycling, or playing basketball. It can track calories burned, steps and strides, and heart rate. There&#x27;s also a sedentary reminder that prompts you to get moving if you stay dormant for too long.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s just where the features begin. You don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping the watch dry when you&#x27;re working up a sweat. The watch has an IP68 waterproof rating, which not only means the device is dust-tight, but that it&#x27;s also capable of withstanding prolonged water exposure and immersion beyond one meter. Sizewise, the watch fits comfortably on men and women with wrist sizes ranging from 5.4 inches to 8.6 inches. On a full charge, the lithium battery-powered watch has up to 240 hours or between 10-20 days of battery life for moderate use, and 1-10 days with frequent use. With the watch, you get two interchangeable straps: one Milan steel and one silicone, the latter of which is great for when you&#x27;re being active.</p>
<p>Customize your design with the pre-installed watch faces or create your own through the accompanying Gloryfit app.</p>
<p>Shoppers love the cost effectiveness of the watch. They say the battery life is &quot;incredible&quot; and that it&#x27;s often mistaken for more expensive options on the market due to its sleek, high-quality design. One shopper even says that she seems to get better sound quality through her watch than her iPhone.</p>
<p>A smartwatch certainly isn&#x27;t an essential, but when you can access everything you need to simply with a glance of your wrist, why not invest in your own? Get the Mingdaln Waterproof Smartwatch for 85% before other shoppers snatch up the amazing deal.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Tesla shareholders respond to latest push against Elon Musk</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/automotive/tesla-shareholders-respond-to-latest-push-against-elon-musk'>Original</a> — 3206 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/thestreet_e4498494cb54.jpg'></p>
<p>On Oct. 17, proxy advisor firm Institutional Shareholder Services urged shareholders to vote &quot;no&quot; on the pay package, potentially be worth $1 trillion, that Tesla TSLA has proposed for CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p>On Monday, Oct. 20, fellow advisory firm Glass Lewis &amp; Co. followed suit, urging Tesla stockholders to reject the proposal.</p>
<p>Glass Lewis says the pay plan warrants &quot;significant concern&quot; due to the potential dilution of shareholder power, according to Bloomberg, which viewed the report.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ISS said it had &quot;unmitigated concerns&quot; about the proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;While it is recognized that the board seeks to retain Musk due to his track record and vision for Tesla&#x27;s future, and further that some shareholders may support this award in light of Musk&#x27;s successes in achieving growth of the company, there are unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award&#x27;s magnitude and design,&quot; ISS said in a recent note.</p>
<p>On Oct. 20, Tesla responded to Glass Lewis.</p>
<p>Concern about Musk&#x27;s compensation isn&#x27;t anything new for ISS, Glass Lewis, or Tesla.</p>
<p>The pair have consistently warned against giving Musk too much control of the company, but Tesla points out that he has rewarded shareholders&#x27; faith in him so far.</p>
<p>Tesla called the Glass Lewis and ISS notes &quot;misguided&quot; and reminded shareholders that &quot;these firms do not own Tesla - you do.&quot;</p>
<p>On X (formerly Twitter), Tesla posted:</p>
<p>Shareholders have spoken twice on Elon&#x27;s 2018 CEO Performance Award. ISS&#x27;s and Glass Lewis&#x27;s recommendations attempt to override the mandate our shareholders delivered to Elon and ignore the staggering financial results delivered under Elon&#x27;s leadership.</p>
<p>Like ISS, Glass Lewis also recommended that shareholders vote against longtime Musk confidant Ira Ehrenpreis retaining his independent director board seat. Ehrenpreis joined the board in May 2007 and is its longest-serving member.</p>
<p>Unlike ISS, Glass Lewis also said shareholders should vote against Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, another Musk confidant who has been a member of Tesla&#x27;s board since December 2018.</p>
<p>&quot;Kathleen has been a part of two of the most transparent governance processes in modern day corporate America and brings decades of legal, operating, compensation, human capital and management expertise critical to winning the AI talent war,&quot; Tesla said on X.</p>
<p>To keep Tesla CEO Elon Musk happy, the company needs to pay him a lot more money and give him much more power.</p>
<p>Last month, Tesla awarded Elon Musk a new pay package that is worth about $29 billion now, subject to shareholder approval. However, the package will be worth much more than that if Tesla reaches the valuation it says it can.</p>
<p>Shareholders are set to vote on the proposal at the company&#x27;s annual meeting on November 6.</p>
<p>Tesla says shareholders should vote &quot;yes&quot; on all the company&#x27;s proposals, but one expert says they should think twice about giving Musk all of that power.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Musk too distracted by SpaceX, xAI, and everything else to give Tesla his full focus? That&#x27;s a fair question... and exactly why strong, independent board oversight matters,&quot; Dominick Miserandino of Retail Tech Media Nexus said.</p>
<p>&quot;Free markets don&#x27;t mean free passes; accountability and transparency still count.&quot;</p>

<p>TheStreet aims to feature only the best products and services.  If you buy something via one of our links, we may earn a commission.</p>
<p>One of the hardest parts of getting new furniture isn&#x27;t just the time it takes to pick the right one to begin with. The real tricky part can be putting the pieces together. Rather than hiring someone to do it for you, you can save your money and invest it in another home upgrade when you opt for furniture that requires little to no assembly. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new sectional, you&#x27;re in luck, because we&#x27;ve been spotting them left and right, and many don&#x27;t require assembly at all.</p>
<p>The Fvbeaya Cloud Sectional Sofa is one of our latest Walmart finds that takes comfortable and convenient seating to the next level. Not only is it modular and easy to put together, but it&#x27;s also on sale. Thanks to  a Flash deal, you can get the $600 sectional sofa for just $387.</p>
<p>Combining style, comfort, and versatility, this cloud sectional sofa has everything you could possibly want in living room seating. It has a modular design with clean lines and thick armrests, and since it&#x27;s in two pieces, its configuration options are almost endless, too. You can set it up as an L-shaped sectional, move the pieces together to create a large bed, separate them to create dueling loveseats, or arrange them so you have a seating area with cozy and defined spaces.</p>
<p>The sectional features deep, 27.1-inch seats and a chaise with a depth of 59.8 inches, both of which you can easily cozy up in to relax or take an afternoon nap. And with high-resilience memory foam throughout, you may never want to get up, as shoppers say it&#x27;s incredibly comfortable. The sectional is upholstered in &quot;plush and cozy&quot; corduroy fabric that&#x27;s breathable and soft with texture that gives it an extra luxurious look and feel. Not to mention, the cover is removable, so it&#x27;s easy to wash and clean.</p>
<p>Best of all, this sectional is completely assembly-free. Since it doesn&#x27;t have a wooden frame and only consists of two pieces, all you have to do is unpack each piece. Then, give it 72 hours to fully expand, and your new favorite piece of furniture will be ready to lounge on.</p>
<p>Walmart shoppers raved about this cloud couch, saying it&#x27;s &quot;super comfortable and soft.&quot; Reviewers shared that it&#x27;s great for relaxing, whether you want to read a book, watch a movie, or play a video game. One customer said it&#x27;s been a great addition to their living room, since it&#x27;s both comfortable and stylish.</p>
<p>The Fvbeaya Cloud Sectional Couch is on sale for just $387, which isn&#x27;t a deal you see often when it comes to sectional sofas. However, as a Flash deal, it won&#x27;t be discounted for long. Shop it while you can, and you&#x27;ll be on your way to cloud-like luxury in no time.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Las Vegas Strip resort venue files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/retail/las-vegas-strip-casino-venue-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy'>Original</a> — 3314 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/thestreet_9fec38bbfc8c.jpg'></p>
<p>Bankruptcy filings are not a common occurrence among Las Vegas Strip casinos and businesses.</p>
<p>The last significant bankruptcy on the Strip was over 10 years ago in January 2015 when Caesars Entertainment, then-owned by Apollo Global Management and TPG Capital, filed for Chapter 11 to eliminate about $16 billion in debt.</p>
<p>Chinese-themed Lucky Dragon Casino, which opened in Las Vegas in 2016, filed for bankruptcy and closed down in 2018.</p>
<p>Las Vegas-based privately held casino operator Maverick Gaming LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 14, 2025, a month after S&amp;P Global Ratings withdrew all of its ratings on the company.</p>
<p>Maverick Gaming owned four Northern Nevada casinos located in Elko and Wendover, Nev., 17 cardrooms in Washington state, and three casinos in Colorado when it filed for bankruptcy. Its casino holdings included 2,500 slot machines, 320 table games, 1,200 hotel rooms, and 30 restaurants.</p>
<p>While no casinos on the Strip  have filed for bankruptcy in many years, a business located in a casino resort venue has filed a Chapter 11 petition.</p>

<p>Electric Playhouse, the Las Vegas Strip&#x27;s unique adult interactive social gaming venue, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize its business.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque-based parent company filed its petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada on Oct. 20, listing $1 million to $10 million in assets and liabilities, according to RK Consultants.</p>
<p>Electric Playhouse NV LLC did not state a reason for filing for bankruptcy in its petition.</p>
<p>The high-tech entertainment venue opened its first interactive location in Albuquerque in 2021.</p>
<p>The 10,000 square-foot entertanment venue opened inside The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace Las Vegas on the Terrace Level on the Strip on June 22, 2024, offering dozens of motion-activated games and experiences, where players&#x27; bodies become the game controllers, without the need of headsets and gadgets.</p>
<p>The venue is equipped with a network of sensors that generate a real-time point cloud, enabling precise tracking of individuals and large groups throughout the facility, according a statement on the Electric Playhouse website.</p>
<p>The volumetric data is used to create a digital twin of each guest, similar to a player inside a video game. As guests move, the walls, floors and tables react to their actions in a variety of ways, enhanced by 360-degree projection mapping that fully immerses guests in interactive games and dining experiences.</p>
<p>The venue also has an outdoor patio with views of the Strip and a bar and restaurant, Electric Elixirs, which offers a dining menu, including chicken wings and tenders, wraps, salads, bowls, either personal pizza or slices, and pastries or Dubai chocolate bar for dessert.</p>
<p>&quot;In a world where passively sitting in front of screens with video games, smartphones, VR and TV is all too common, Electric Playhouse provides an active, social and energetic entertainment alternative,&quot; Electric Playhouse CEO and co-founder Brandon Garrett said in a statement when the venue opened.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to re-energize the way people of all ages interact with technology by inviting them into an experiential world where they can connect, play and create lasting memories together,&quot; Garrett said.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Daily Market Wrap - Top Stocks: Apple, Netflix and CoreWeave</h2>

<p>The Amazon Web Services outage disrupted work during the Monday morning rush hour, but it did little to dampen Wall Street&#x27;s momentum. The market surged across the board, led by strong gains in Apple and optimism ahead of a heavy earnings week.</p>
<p>Optimism about artificial industry and the potential for a government reopening contributed to a bullish market as we enter the 20th day of shutdown.</p>
<p>Market veteran Dan Niles, Founder of Niles Investment Management, said on X.</p>
<p>&quot;While I believe the market is suffering from &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; given current valuations, I believe it can extend even further fueled by easy money, strong Q3 earnings and AI optimism.&quot;</p>
<p>Niles added, &quot;The goal is to catch as much of this inflating AI bubble as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors are also eyeing a key CPI report, which is needed for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and potentially influences what&#x27;s next for Fed interest rate cuts, even as most government operations remain stalled.</p>

<p>Apple&#x27;s stock was up 4.5% on Monday owing to optimistic iPhone sales. Netflix stock was trading 3.5% higher ahead of its Q3 report on Oct. 21. CoreWeave, an up-and-coming cloud infrastructure provider, suffered, with its stock down 7%.</p>
<p>Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah upgraded Apple to Buy from Hold with a price target of $315 from $226, citing &quot;material upside&quot; to iPhone shipment estimates through 2027.</p>
<p>The firm&#x27;s supply chain checks suggest that Apple could be entering a multi-year iPhone refresh and design cycle that may deliver three consecutive record years of shipments.</p>
<p>Everscore ISI also added Apple to the firm&#x27;s &quot;Tactical Outperform List&quot;, maintaining Outperform rating and a $290 price target. The firm pointed to stronger-than-expected iPhone demand and higher lead times than the prior model, as reported by TheFly.</p>
<p>Wedbush reiterated an Outperform rating and a price target of $1,500 on the stock, saying that research indicates strong subscriber retention and acceptance of recent price increases.</p>
<p>The firm noted that advertising revenue could become Netflix&#x27;s primary growth driver by 2026, fueled by live event programming, better ad targeting and broader ad partnerships.</p>
<p>In a surprise collaboration, AMC Entertainment (AMC) announced that it will screen Netflix&#x27;s most-watched film, KPop Demon Hunters, across 400 theatres in the US and Europe starting Halloween weekend.</p>
<p>AMC CEO Adam Aron posted to X, &quot;Netflix, the world&#x27;s largest streaming service, and AMC Entertainment, the world&#x27;s largest theatre chain, have jointly decided to work together. This new cooperation will start this Halloween weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>Aron said that the partnership opens &quot;mutually beneficial opportunities&quot; between the two companies, hinting at further cooperation ahead.</p>
<p>Investment firm Two Seas Capital, one of Core Scientific&#x27;s largest shareholders, urged investors to vote against the merger, arguing that CoreWeave&#x27;s attempt to acquire Core Scientific substantially undervalues the company &quot;at a time of unprecedented value creation across the sector.&quot;</p>
<p>The firm believes Core Scientific could achieve greater returns as an independent company.</p>
<p>CoreWeave considers the acquisition pivotal to cementing its position as a force in the AI cloud infrastructure space.</p>
<p>Additionally, CoreWeave announced the appointment of Jon Jones as its first Chief Revenue Officer. Jones, a former Amazon executive, is expected to spearhead global expansion as the company scales its AI-focused cloud infrastructure business.</p>
<p>Michael Intrator, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of CoreWeave, said of Jones&#x27; appointment,</p>
<p>&quot;The scale of AI adoption demands entirely new products and services, and with Jon Jones on board, we are well-positioned to extend our leadership as the platform of choice for AI innovation and adoption.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>More police agencies adopt AI, raising efficiency — and concern</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/technology/more-police-agencies-adopt-ai-raising-efficiency-and-concern'>Original</a> — 3640 chars</p>

<p>The legendary TV detective, portrayed by Jack Webb in the long-running show &quot;Dragnet,&quot; who famously wanted just the facts, would be shocked to see the impact artificial intelligence is having on modern-day crimefighting.</p>
<p>Police departments have been making use of such innovations as predictive policing, where AI algorithms analyze large datasets, like historical crime data, social-media activity and environmental factors, to predict where and when crimes are likely to occur.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also facial recognition technology and biometrics - both of which have sparked controversy.</p>
<p>&quot;Reporting is a critical component of good police work; however, it has become a significant part of the job that officers commonly refer to as &#x27;burdensome,&#x27; &quot; the Scottsdale, Ariz., company says, noting that every week officers in the U.S. can spend up to 40% of their time - or 15 hours of a 40-hour week - on what is essentially data entry.</p>
<p>Axon said that agency trials have resulted in roughly one hour of time saved per day on paperwork. For every eight officers who use Draft One during their workdays, that translates to an extra eight-hour shift or more, the company added.</p>
<p>&quot;Draft One remains our fastest-adopted software solution,&quot; Axon Founder and Chief Executive Rick Smith told analysts during the company&#x27;s second-quarter earnings call in August.</p>
<p>&quot;When customers start to use a product like Draft One for 60 days [they] say, &#x27;man, I&#x27;m spending a full day more every week on the road fighting crime as opposed to sitting behind a computer,&quot; Chief Operating Officer Josh Isner said. &quot;Those are the kinds of stories that just build.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was a little bit skeptical; I&#x27;m not a big technology person,&quot; Brittingham said in a March interview at the Fort Collins police station for CNN&#x27;s Terms of Service podcast.</p>
<p>But spending less time writing reports means Brittingham can &quot;take more calls for service&quot; and &quot;be proactive in preventing crime,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Axon declined to say how many departments currently use Draft One, but police have also adopted it in Lafayette, Ind.; Tampa, Fla.; and Campbell, Calif.</p>
<p>Police departments in Minnesota are increasingly using artificial intelligence to write police reports, KSTP reported earlier this month.</p>
<p>Draft One uses Generative AI &quot;and includes a range of critical safeguards, requiring every report to be reviewed and approved by a human officer, ensuring accuracy and accountability of the information before reports are submitted,&quot; Axon says.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the technology has raised concerns. Both California and Utah have laws that require disclosure when artificial intelligence is used to generate police reports.</p>
<p>A study by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said its investigation found that Draft One &quot;seems deliberately designed to avoid audits that could provide any accountability to the public.&quot;</p>
<p>The foundation said that Draft One uses a ChatGPT variant to process body-worn camera audio of public encounters and create police reports based only on the captured verbal dialogue. It does not process the video.</p>
<p>&quot;The Draft One-generated text is sprinkled with bracketed placeholders that officers are encouraged to add additional observations or information - or can be quickly deleted,&quot; the group said, adding that the product offers &quot;meager oversight features that deliberately conceal how it is used.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Draft One was designed to mirror the existing police narrative process - where, as has long been standard, only the final, approved report is saved and discoverable, not the interim edits, additions, or deletions made during officer or supervisor review.&quot;</p>

<p>As colorful leaves pile high in your yard and temperatures begin to drop, you may find yourself reaching for that favorite hoodie or jacket when you go out to ward off the chill. But when you&#x27;re relaxing at home on the couch, you probably want to wrap up in something cozy before you dive into your next book or Netflix binge. You want the kind of blanket that&#x27;s not too lightweight and not too heavy at this time of year - basically, the perfect transition throw.</p>
<p>Enter the Amelie Faux Fur Throw, which is on sale at Amazon right now for just $30. It normally retails for $70, but you can save $40 on the Textured Orange Brown color if it happens to jive with your aesthetic (and since it&#x27;s the quintessential fall shade, we&#x27;re feeling it all the way).</p>
<p>The Amelie Faux Fur throw measures 60 by 80 inches, which technically means it would fit a twin bed perfectly. But it&#x27;s also large enough to cover you and a companion, either of the two- or four-legged variety. It&#x27;s super soft and feels like real fur, and is also Oeko-Tex certified, so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin types.</p>
<p>While the $30 deal applies to the 60 by 80 size and Textured Orange Brown color only, this blanket does come in other sizes (55 by 70 inches and 88 by 90 inches) and 18 other shades. The prices range from $26 to $53, depending on what option you go for. But when it comes to the best deal of them all, our pick is the way to go.</p>
<p>Caring for this throw is also simple. When it&#x27;s in need of a wash, you can just toss it in the machine and use the gentle cycle with cold water, easy as that. While you can dry it on high heat, we recommend a few cycles on low for the best results. It is worth noting that the throw comes vacuum-sealed and will expand to its full size after it&#x27;s been opened.</p>
<p>More than 200 shoppers have given this blanket a 5-star rating, highlighting everything from its weight to its ease of care. One shopper calls it &quot;exceptionally well made&quot; and mentions it does not shed, while another calls it &quot;gorgeous,&quot; saying, &quot;This is the nicest throw/blanket I have purchased. I have three others. Very soft and fairly heavy.&quot;</p>
<p>With chilly weather either already here or right around the corner, depending on where you live, it&#x27;s the perfect time to invest in a blanket that will carry you through the fall and winter months. The Amelie Faux Fur Throw from Amazon is a simply fantastic pick, and at only $30, it&#x27;s a total steal. Grab one now and prepare to spend the next few months in cozy luxury.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Disney World replaces iconic restaurant with chicken nugget, burger eatery</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/travel/disney-world-closes-beloved-eatery-as-part-of-a-major-transformation'>Original</a> — 4207 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/thestreet_6dc9f6385418.jpg'></p>
<p>Walt Disney World is closing one of its most distinctive quick-service eateries - but it&#x27;s already planning a major comfort food comeback.</p>
<p>As of October 20, 2025, Harambe Market, located in the Africa section of Animal Kingdom, has officially shut down for refurbishment and will reopen in early 2026 as a hamburger and chicken nuggets restaurant, according to a DisneyByMark report.</p>
<p>For nearly a decade, Harambe Market was celebrated for its African-inspired street food, from grilled meats and rice bowls to plant-based dishes that reflected the details of a bustling East African marketplace.</p>
<p>The open-air food court, set against themed façades of realistic-looking market stalls,  drew praise for its authenticity and atmosphere rather than typical theme park fare.</p>
<p>That era, however, appears to be coming to a close.</p>
<p>The updated Harambe Market will take over as the new home base for crowd-pleasing staples currently served at Restaurantosaurus in DinoLand U.S.A., which will close permanently in February 2026 as part of the land&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Tropical Americas&quot; transformation.</p>
<p>This change is part of a park-wide dining reshuffle accompanying the permanent closure of Trilo-Bites and Dino-Bite Snacks, two longtime snack counters in DinoLand U.S.A. Known for their ice cream, Dole Whip floats, and Buffalo Chicken Chips, both stands are now closed.</p>
<p>The crowd-favorite chips will move to Eight Spoon Café on Discovery Island, while various floats will be served at Warung Outpost in Asia. Hand-scooped ice cream, meanwhile, is not expected to return to Animal Kingdom until early 2026.​</p>
<p>During the interim construction period, Disney announced that Kusafiri Coffee Shop &amp; Bakery in the same Harambe area will offer expanded lunch options. These include rice bowls, wraps, and plant-based meals to fill the gap while Harambe Market undergoes renovation.​</p>
<p>The closure of Harambe Market also ties directly into the much larger overhaul of Animal Kingdom&#x27;s DinoLand U.S.A., set to become a Tropical Americas land inspired by Central and South American landscapes and cultures.</p>
<p>The new land will reportedly introduce attractions themed to &quot;Encanto&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones,&quot; marking one of the park&#x27;s most ambitious reimaginings since &quot;Pandora: The World of Avatar&quot; debuted in 2017. With Restaurantosaurus, Trilo-Bites, and Dino-Bite Snacks disappearing, Disney appears to be consolidating its quick-service food infrastructure to serve especially busy park zones.​</p>
<p>Work could conclude by late spring 2026. However, Disney insiders indicate that the popular dining area is expected to reopen months earlier - i.e., in time for President&#x27;s Day crowds in February and well ahead of spring break crowds.​</p>
<p>TheStreet reached out to Disney for comment on the timeline but had not received a response at the time of publishing.</p>
<p>Some longtime visitors are sure to be disappointed by the loss of African street eats, but the decision seems to stem from on logistics and guest volume.</p>
<p>Burgers and nuggets remain some of Disney&#x27;s top-selling dishes across its parks, and moving Restaurantosaurus&#x27; menu to Harambe Market ensures that Animal Kingdom retains a high-capacity quick-service dining option while construction reshapes DinoLand.</p>
<p>At a May media conference, Chairman of Disney Experiences Josh D&#x27;Amaro explained how updates like these reflect a larger strategy across Disney&#x27;s parks. D&#x27;Amaro&#x27;s comments, as reported by DisneyFoodBlog, point to the company&#x27;s dining refreshes, which aim to make menus approachable while aligning park zones with broader storytelling themes.</p>
<p>There is &quot;literally nothing like it in the world. We&#x27;re always making sure that we&#x27;re delivering value to every one of our guests that comes into one of our experiences or theme parks,&quot; D&#x27;Amaro said.</p>
<p>As Animal Kingdom transitions toward the new &quot;Tropical Americas&quot; land, the changes at Harambe Market&#x27;s show how food service is an integral part of any Disney theme park transformation.</p>

<p>Can anyone argue about how essential pantry storage is for any kitchen? Before the refrigerator, this is where singles and families alike would go when it was time to prep a meal, using shelf-stable essentials like pasta, rice, and flour to make breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the occasional snack. With modern tech, there&#x27;s another place in your kitchen that could easily double as a second pantry: your freezer. Sure, your fridge keeps food fresher longer, but the freezer can keep things from spoiling for months, if not years.</p>
<p>Everyone can use extra freezer space, whether you want to stock up for the winter or be able to jump on discounted meat and ice cream without having it spoil on you before you get to it. No matter how small your kitchen is, you&#x27;ll likely be able to fit in the $230 Auseo Mini Freezer Chest, which is on sale at Walmart for just $160.</p>
<p>Adding extra freezer space to your kitchen is like buying a cordless vacuum cleaner: you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever lived without it. There&#x27;s a reason a lot of modern refrigerators provide more and more freezer space. Having access to frozen food, be it everyday staples or leftovers that you stored for a rainy day, is one of those quality-of-life improvements that pays off in dividends for years to come. Shoppers are calling this small freezer &quot;deep and spacious&quot; and love how it tucks away into even tiny kitchens.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the perfect size for my apartment and holds enough food for me for a few weeks,&quot; one shopper said. This 31.8-inch-tall chest holds up to 2.7 cubic feet of storage space for seasonal fruit, meat, ready-made dinners, and snacks like mozzarella sticks and potato skins that may not fit in your already cramped freezer.</p>
<p>There are two removable baskets that make filling and emptying the freezer easier, but you could easily slide them out for even more storage space. It provides a temperature range of anywhere from -11 to -50 degrees Fahrenheit, which you can modify using a simple dial. It&#x27;s even got an easy drainage port when you need to run a defrosting cycle.</p>
<p>When buying a large kitchen appliance - even one with such a low profile - it&#x27;s key that you ensure that you have the space for it before purchasing. More importantly, you should also check that there&#x27;s a three-pronged outlet nearby.</p>
<p>KitchenAid mixers and Vitamix blenders may be coveted, but they don&#x27;t provide what a chest freezer does, which is freedom. Having extra freezer space means you&#x27;ll always have all your favorites on hand when dinner time rolls around, no matter how stuffed your refrigerator is. The Auseo Mini Freezer is an excellent addition to your kitchen, especially at Walmart&#x27;s discounted price of just $160.</p>

<p>Frozen waffles, toaster pastries, bagels, toast, and English muffins aren&#x27;t just delicious breakfast fare; they can also be quickly prepared in the toaster. For decades, using a toaster has meant guesswork that oftentimes results in undercooked or badly burnt outcomes. Modern touchscreen toasters have improved this experience in recent years so that you can perfectly prepare morning meals each and every time.</p>
<p>Since digital toasters are more high-tech than the traditional version, they usually cost quite a bit more. Walmart is now making it more affordable to invest in one of these innovative items with a limited-time flash deal on the Whallultra 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster. Normally retailing for $160, this convenient kitchen appliance has been massively marked down by 69%, which brings the total to just $50. If you want something even more affordable, the two-slice model is also on sale for just $38 with a 68% discount.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;ve never had the chance to try out a touchscreen toaster for yourself, you&#x27;ll be amazed by the intelligent interface and seamless user experience. To get the perfect toastiness, the screen has six bread types to choose from, including regular bread, bagels, gluten-free bread, English muffins, waffles, and pastries. Next, you&#x27;ll choose from six shade settings, starting with barely toasted and reaching a darkness that&#x27;s just shy of burnt. You can further customize this electronic toaster&#x27;s settings if your food is frozen or only needs reheating. Once the toasting begins, a countdown timer starts to let you know the exact time it will take to pop up.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not just the intelligent features that make this smart toaster so incredible. As one shopper describes, it &quot;looks sleek, is easy to use, and toasts like a champ.&quot; The modern, yet timeless design uses long-lasting stainless steel that will look great on any kitchen countertop.</p>
<p>Since it&#x27;s equipped with oversized slots, measuring 1.5 inches wide, this toaster won&#x27;t smoosh thick bagels and breads. Plus, clean-up is made easy with a removable crumb tray. On top of that, the right and left sides work independently, so you can make toast for yourself and Pop-Tarts for your children simultaneously, even if they need different settings.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive things about this smart toaster, outside of the quality construction and impressive functions, is the rave reviews. With an average customer rating of 4.7 out of five stars, this kitchen appliance has been given perfect five-star reviews from more than 1,300 shoppers. &quot;It&#x27;s perfect for busy mornings,&quot; said one reviewer. They added that the toaster&#x27;s &quot;compact size and stainless steel finish add a modern touch.&quot;</p>
<p>Walmart&#x27;s Flash deal on the Whallultra 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster, which brings the price down to just $50, is only available for a limited time. Secure $110 in savings by adding this top-rated pick to your cart now.</p>

<p>The best dressers on the market are the ones that don&#x27;t necessarily have to remain confined to the bedroom. If you can find a spacious dresser that works as well in the living room as a TV stand or near the front door as an entryway catch-all, then you have a real gem. Thanks to Amazon, we think we found a diamond in the rough, and it&#x27;s one of the most versatile pieces we&#x27;ve seen in a while. It also happens to be available for a very low price right now, so it&#x27;s definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s plenty to be excited about when it comes to this dresser. With a lightweight powder-coated stainless steel frame, it&#x27;s incredibly stable while still being easy to move around the house. Adding to the convenience are adjustable feet on each leg, which allow you to compensate for uneven flooring, keeping the piece on an even keel. Even the drawers themselves keep the overall weight to a minimum, as they&#x27;re made from medium-density fiberboard (MDF) that&#x27;s wrapped in fabric.</p>
<p>The dresser has three small drawers at the top that are perfect for socks in the bedroom, TV remotes in the living room, or keys in the entryway. The lower drawers are larger and can hold just about anything you have a need for, regardless of the room where the dresser may be positioned. At the top of the dresser is a waterproof woodgrain MDF countertop that&#x27;s sturdy and easy to wipe clean with soap and water. It&#x27;s perfect for additional storage or even as a display area for your decor pieces. Matching ergonomic handles make the drawers extremely easy to open and close.</p>
<p>This convenient little piece of furniture also has a built-in anti-tip system. Holes in the frame allow you to attach it directly to the wall via screws. That means you&#x27;ll never need to worry about the piece falling over, even when it&#x27;s completely full. The dresser&#x27;s overall dimensions are 39.4 inches long by 11.8 inches wide by 39.4 inches tall. It&#x27;s the perfect size for just about any room in the home.</p>
<p>Amazon shoppers were totally thrilled with this dresser. One claimed &quot;it has plenty of storage with smooth-gliding drawers, adding that it&#x27;s a &quot;stylish and functional addition&quot; to their space. They also shared that the assembly was easy and that the dresser feels sturdy.</p>
<p>If you love furniture that can do just about anything you need it to, then consider buying the Dwvo 9-Drawer Dresser. It&#x27;s currently on sale for only $51 at Amazon, but there&#x27;s no telling how long that price may last. Get yours now before the inventory dwindles down or the price shoots back up.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Bank of America resets inflation prediction ahead of CPI</h2>

<p>Wall Street and Main Street are wringing their hands over the next inflation update from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Oct. 24. The BLS&#x27;s monthly Consumer Price Index is a major inflation measure that could sway the likelihood that the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates when it meets on Oct. 29.</p>
<p>The last CPI data from August weren&#x27;t overly reassuring. It showed headline inflation increased to 2.9%, due mainly to recently instituted tariffs. For comparison, the CPI reading in April, before most of President Trump&#x27;s tariffs went into effect, showed inflation of 2.3%.</p>
<p>The September CPI print is particularly anticipated because its release was delayed due to the government shutdown. So it lands just ahead of the Fed&#x27;s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, providing one of the last bits of information that could determine whether Fed officials think inflation is getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Ahead of the CPI report, Wall Street firms, including Bank of America, are updating their inflation predictions.</p>
<p>The Fed&#x27;s monetary policy decisions are governed by a dual mandate to maintain low unemployment and inflation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, those two goals are often at odds, and that&#x27;s especially true in 2025.</p>
<p>When the Fed raises interest rates (as it did in 2022 and 2023), inflation falls but unemployment rises. Lowering the Federal Funds Rate has the opposite effect.</p>
<p>That dynamic led Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to delay rate cuts over concern that they would fuel inflationary fires as tariffs increased costs to businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>The Fed&#x27;s inflation target is 2%, so the increase since spring has pressured the central bank toward patience. That hesitancy has increased the possibility that the Fed has fallen behind the curve when it comes to lowering rates to prop up the economy and support the jobs market.</p>
<p>If inflation continues to climb further above the Fed&#x27;s inflation target, Powell and company could find themselves boxed into a corner, once again hesitant to cut interest rates further over fears of sending inflation skyrocketing as it did in 2022. At that time Consumer Price Index inflation exceeded 8% before retreating due to stiff rate hikes.</p>
<p>Bank of America&#x27;s latest number crunching suggests that prices likely moved up again in September, but only slightly.</p>
<p>Digging deeper into the numbers, Bank of America sees core goods prices up 0.1% from August, a &quot;moderation from the trailing three-month average.&quot; However, it thinks that moderation stems from a drop in used-car prices. Excluding that factor, it says &quot;core goods prices likely rose by 0.2% [month over month,] in line with the last two months.&quot;</p>
<p>The investment firm&#x27;s economists also see core services inflation up 0.3% during the month, a &quot;slight moderation from the 0.4% m/m prints in each of the last two months.&quot; However, they view that level as &quot;still too firm for comfort.&quot;</p>
<p>We continue to expect tariffs to remain a source of goods price inflation over the next few quarters.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Bank of America says the impact of tariffs on inflation isn&#x27;t yet over.</p>
<p>In the absence of the BLS&#x27;s jobs data, the Fed will likely rely on other measures to see if its quarter-percentage-point cut in September is helping.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, data from private-payroll processor ADP paint an ugly picture. ADP says the U.S. economy lost 32,000 jobs in September, far shy of the job gains economists expected.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that there&#x27;s been a steady drumbeat of layoffs this year. According to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, U.S. employers have announced 946,426 layoffs this year through September. That&#x27;s the most since 2020 and up 55% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Jobs data from Bank of America released earlier this month further muddy the waters. An analysis of payroll and unemployment checks flowing into its customers&#x27; accounts suggests that the jobs market weakened again last month. In a separate report, Bank of America also highlighted a dropoff in hiring activity at small businesses.</p>
<p>The cracks in the employment market suggest that the Fed doesn&#x27;t have much choice but to keep lowering rates to support the economy. So if Bank of America is correct that headline CPI only inches up, it&#x27;s unlikely to pour cold water on another quarter-point cut at the meeting later this month.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not think the report will be a game changer for the Fed. We expect&quot; a 25-basis-point cut in October, concludes Bank of America&#x27;s analysts.</p>

<p>Amazon has grown since it launched as an online bookstore in 1995 to become the dominant player in web hosting 30 years later.</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) was launched in 2006, and over the last decade, it has become the largest cloud computing provider in the world.</p>
<p>AWS generated $107.6 billion in revenue for Amazon in 2024, a 19% increase from the previous year. While that is only a fraction of the $670 billion the company brought in, AWS is so popular and cost-effective that it accounts for over 50% of Amazon&#x27;s yearly profits.</p>
<p>Netflix, Adobe, Apple, Capital One, Disney, and BMW all use AWS computing power to run their online presences. NASA, GE, Pfizer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson do as well.</p>
<p>So when users started reporting outages early the morning of Oct. 20, there was no telling how big the problem was.</p>
<p>Early on Oct. 20, a notice on the AWS status page said that it was experiencing DNS, or Domain Name System, issues with its database service, DynamoDB, which underpins many of its other applications.</p>
<p>DNS allows web browsers to find websites by translating their names into IP addresses.</p>
<p>The first outage was reported at 12:11 a.m. PDT in AWS&#x27; US-East-1 region hosted in northern Virginia. By 3:35 a.m. PDT, AWS said the issue had been fully mitigated and that operations were back to normal.</p>
<p>But the company has continued fixing the issue all morning, while providing numerous updates.</p>
<p>According to the outage detection and reporting website Downdetector, several high-profile clients were affected.</p>
<p>Users on Downdetector showed some concern about the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it comes back up. We need AWS to run our weekly payroll later today,&quot; user Matthew Fierro wrote.</p>
<p>Thousands of people commented on X, formerly Twitter, but one high-profile user took the opportunity to kick Amazon while it was down.</p>
<p>Ever the gamesman, self-proclaimed online troll Elon Musk on Oct. 20 took a shot at AWS on X.</p>
<p>&quot;Messages on X chat are fully encrpyted with no advertising hooks or strange &#x27;AWS dependencies,&#x27; so I can&#x27;t read your messages even if someone put a gun to my head,&quot; Musk said. &quot;You can do file transfers and audio/video calls.&quot;</p>
<p>While AWS was down, he made sure to note that &quot;X works.&quot;</p>
<p>The outage didn&#x27;t just affect websites in the U.S. AWS is a global company, and in the UK, banking giant Lloyds and telecom service providers Vodafone and BT reported issues as well.</p>
