- **Features**:
  - Extended thinking enabled (5000 token budget)
  - Lower temperature (0.5 vs 0.7) → More focused analysis
  - Research-specific prompts
  - Identifies research gaps and limitations
  - Tags questions with cognitive difficulty levels
  - Provides academic-focused perspectives

### 4. **API Mode Comparison Tool** ✅ NEW

## 📈 **Test Results: Chat vs Research Mode**

### **Performance Comparison**

| Metric | Chat Mode | Research Mode |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Response Time** | 152.3s | 208.9s |
| **Speed Ratio** | 1.0x | 1.37x slower ⚠️ |
| **Questions Generated** | 10 | 10 |
| **Keywords** | 10 | 8 (more specialized) |

### **Question Quality Comparison**

**Chat Mode:**
```
Question Types:
- What questions: 3 (facts)
- How questions: 3 (processes)
- Why questions: 4 (analysis)
```

**Research Mode:**
```
Difficulty Levels:
- Basic: 1
- Intermediate: 5
- Advanced: 4

Cognitive Levels (Bloom's Taxonomy):
- Comprehension: 1
- Application: 2
- Analysis: 3
- Synthesis: 2
- Evaluation: 2
```

## 🎯 **Recommendations**

### **Use CHAT MODE when:**
✅ You need **fast batch processing** (150s vs 200s+ per article)  
✅ You're processing **many articles** (20+ articles)  
✅ You want **straightforward, accessible content**  
✅ **Speed is critical** for your workflow  
✅ Target: **General learning**, K-12, beginner levels  

### **Use RESEARCH MODE when:**
✅ You need **deeper academic analysis**  
✅ You want **multi-difficulty questions** for advanced learners  
✅ You need **research gaps identified**  
✅ You want **Bloom's taxonomy classification**  
✅ Target: **University-level analysis**, research, professional development  
✅ **Speed difference is acceptable** (~1 minute extra per article)  

### **Our Recommendation**
**Start with CHAT MODE** (faster) for initial launch, but:
- Allow users to choose analysis depth
- Offer "Deep Dive" option → Uses research mode
- Show expected processing time before starting

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Generate Article Detail Pages**
```bash
python3 generate_article_detail_page.py
# Generates: article_pages/article_[ID].html for all processed articles
```

### **Test Research Mode**
```bash
python3 deepseek_research_processor.py --batch-size 1 --max-batches 1
# Processes 1 article with research mode
# Output: deepseek_research_batch_1.json
```

### **Compare Both Modes**
```bash
python3 compare_api_modes.py
# Processes same article with both modes
# Generates: comparison_report.txt
```
