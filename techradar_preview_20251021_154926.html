<p>Sometimes the easiest explanation is the most obvious</p>
<p>If you believe the reports and images on Reddit, there are some iPhone 17 Pro Cosmic Orange phones that are inexplicably turning pink. There aren&#x27;t many reported cases, but enough that some have already coined the term &quot;Colorgate.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s fun to have a new &quot;gate&quot; to consider, but what if there&#x27;s a simple, scientific explanation for these potential color shifts and the answer has been staring us in the face from one of Apple&#x27;s own support pages all along?</p>
<p>First, we reviewed the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max here and have yet to experience any fading. Even scratchgate hasn&#x27;t reached our new iPhones yet, but the hue and cry surrounding this new issue is such that it&#x27;s worth investigating.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s start by stepping back to understand the iPhone 17 Pro&#x27;s (and 17 Pro Max) finish, the process by which it&#x27;s made, and how it differs from the iPhone 16 Pro line&#x27;s titanium finish.</p>
<p>Titanium is a heavier, stronger metal than aluminum, and when it&#x27;s anodized (an electrochemical process), it adopts a smooth, non-porous finish. Anodizing aluminum, on the other hand, results in a porous finish that can be bathed in a special dye that soaks color into those pores and then is specially sealed.</p>
<p>Those differences in materials and the process by which the iPhone 17 Pro chassis is made allow for the richer iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max colors: Cosmic Orange and Deep Blue.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, Cosmic Orange has turned out to be the more popular color, which may account for the number of reports. But how might that lovely orange fade to an almost equally attractive reddish pink?</p>
<p>Oddly, a partial answer might be found here on this 2013 PF Finishing Products post by Mark Jazefowicz, VP of Technical Services, Reliant Aluminum Products. In it, Jazefowicz writes:</p>
<p>&quot;Color anodized aluminum is widely used as a material in the medical device industry. From tool handles to trays, these repeat-use devices undergo regular cleaning and sterilization treatments, and it is vital that the original finish remain preserved throughout.</p>
<p>Several types of sterilization methods are in use today, but those that incorporate hydrogen peroxide injection are particularly challenging for a color anodized finish to endure, since fading or significant discoloration typically occurs after only a few sterizliation cycles.&quot;</p>
<p>So, according to Jazefowicz, hydrogen peroxide, a chemical that&#x27;s occasionally used to bleach hair, is no friend to an anodized aluminum finish color.</p>
<p>If we needed more evidence, we need only look at Apple&#x27;s own guidance for iPhone cleaning.</p>
<p>Yes, 70% isopropyl alcohol is okay, as is a 75% ethyl alcohol wipe. Even Clorox Disinfecting Wipes pass muster when used gently. But the language is crystal clear: &quot;Don&#x27;t use products containing bleach or hydrogen peroxide.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple isn&#x27;t explaining here why you should never use those solvents, but based on the information from that decade-old-plus article, we can guess why.</p>

<p>OpenSFI layers above AMD&#x27;s openSIL and Intel&#x27;s FSP for unified function calls</p>
<p>A new collaboration between leading chipmakers and cloud firms will bring together AMD, Arm, Intel, Google, ByteDance, Microsoft, MiTAC, HPE, and others to create a more unified firmware foundation.</p>
<p>The initiative, known as openSFI (Open Silicon Firmware Interface), seeks to define a single, architecture-neutral interface for how host firmware communicates with CPU silicon during initialization and operation.</p>
<p>The project is notable for its broad membership, as ByteDance stands out as the only Chinese participant among American and European technology giants.</p>
<p>The openSFI project builds upon and complements AMD&#x27;s ongoing openSIL effort, which aims to replace the proprietary AGESA codebase for silicon initialization with a transparent, open-source alternative.</p>
<p>Within this new structure, openSFI acts as a unified layer sitting atop AMD&#x27;s openSIL and Intel&#x27;s FSP (Firmware Support Package).</p>
<p>In effect, it serves as a shared abstraction point that lets host firmware call standardized functions without concern for the underlying silicon vendor.</p>
<p>This approach could streamline platform development, reduce redundant engineering, and allow firmware to be reused across different CPUs.</p>
<p>The published openSFI 0.3 specification lays out the project&#x27;s design principles and integration model, noting its goal is to, &quot;enable modular, scalable, and vendor-agnostic integration of silicon into host firmware environments.&quot;</p>
<p>The specification emphasizes a stable API contract for host firmware to call silicon initialization functions predictably and consistently.</p>
<p>It also outlines the primary objectives of openSFI: unifying silicon initialization interfaces, simplifying firmware integration, and promoting reusability between vendors to cut validation costs and improve sustainability.</p>
<p>ByteDance&#x27;s involvement is notable in a field often dominated by Western and Japanese semiconductor firms.</p>
<p>By joining openSFI, ByteDance opens an unusual level of engagement between a Chinese tech firm and major U.S. semiconductor companies.</p>
<p>Although the ambition is promising, there is no information on how openSFI will be adopted across competing hardware ecosystems.</p>
<p>Previous attempts at firmware standardization have struggled due to differing vendor interests and evolving hardware platforms.</p>

<div class='article'><h2> Microsoft commits to making Windows 11 ‘AI-native’ - whether you like it or not </h2>
<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/pro/microsoft-commits-to-making-windows-11-ai-native-whether-you-like-it-or-not'>Original</a> - None</em></p>

<p>With Windows 10 hitting EOL, Windows 11 is set to become the AI OS</p>
<p>Now Windows 10 has reached its end-of-life, Microsoft has released more information on its future plans surrounding Windows 11, primarily concerning its commitment to turning the operating system &#x27;AI-native&#x27;.</p>
<p>With Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot AI &#x27;companion&#x27;, the organization wants to push users towards a fully integrated agentic AI experience - with AI no longer just being an &#x27;add on&#x27; tool to the OS, but rather a core part of Windows.</p>
<p>&quot;Windows leads the AI-native shift,&quot; said Stefan Kinnestrand, Vice President at Microsoft. &quot;Windows is evolving into an AI-native platform: secure, scalable, and built for agentic work,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>Copilot+ PCs will be on the hardware side of this commitment, with AI features on the software side, as Microsoft hints new &quot;breakthrough performance and native AI experiences&quot; are set to be arriving soon for Windows 11 users, but only those who already own a Copilot+ PC at first.</p>
<p>&quot;Windows is evolving to more effectively empower organizations to innovate, adapt, and thrive in a rapidly changing business landscape driven by AI &quot; Kinnestrand added.</p>
<p>&quot;With the latest AI features, organizations gain an enterprise-grade foundation where AI powered capabilities operate safely and effectively, unlocking new levels of productivity and business agility.&quot;</p>
<p>But what will this mean for users? Well, it means Copilot will be weaved into PCs with Windows 11, rather than pushing customers to purchase specific Copilot Plus PCs.</p>
<p>Microsoft wants its customers to communicate and work with their PC - out loud.</p>
<p>Workers will also soon get access to new Copilot Voice, Vision, and Action features. Copilot Voice enables voice commands to search, automate tasks, and &#x27;make daily work more intuitive and hands-free&#x27; - whilst Copilot Vision allows the AI access to your screen in real-time and offers analysis and provides instructions on using apps or completing tasks - both &#x27;opt-in permissions&#x27;.</p>
<p>Copilot Action will let Copilot agents perform tasks on the users behalf. Examples Microsoft have given are; &#x27;opening apps, changing settings, or starting workflows-based on context and intent&#x27; - not entirely ground breaking.</p>
<p>Despite all these features, Windows 11 and AI are &#x27;designed to make technology feel invisible, so employees can focus on what matters&#x27; Kinnestrand argues.</p>
<p>The Microsoft ecosystem with fully integrated technology is aimed at helping &#x27;reduce complexity, unlock cross-platform intelligence, and deliver seamless experiences across teams and tools.&#x27;</p>
<p>Finally, there&#x27;s &#x27;Click to Do&#x27;, a productivity tool which Microsoft says will empower users to &#x27;act instantly, such as scheduling meetings or launching tasks, directly from their workspace,&#x27; with workflows streamlined through a single click.</p>
