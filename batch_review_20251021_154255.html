<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump&#x27;s pick to lead an office charged with protecting federal whistleblowers appeared to be in jeopardy on Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he hoped the White House would withdraw the nomination.</p>
<p>The growing opposition to Paul Ingrassia comes after a Politico report of a text chat that showed him saying the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be &quot;tossed into the seventh circle of hell.&quot; Ingrassia also described himself in the chat as having &quot;a Nazi streak&quot; at times.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s not going to pass,&quot; Thune told reporters.</p>
<p>Two Republicans who serve on the committee with jurisdiction over the nomination for the Office of Special Counsel job, Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said they do not support Ingrassia&#x27;s confirmation.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m a no. It never should have got this far,&quot; Johnson said Tuesday. &quot;They ought to pull the nomination.&quot;</p>
<p>Republicans have been able to muscle through the vast majority of Trump&#x27;s nominees in roll call votes despite stiff Democratic opposition. But there have been sporadic instances when Republicans have pushed back, generally behind the scenes, showing there are limits to their support.</p>
<p>Most notably, Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump&#x27;s first choice for attorney general soon after being tabbed for the job. In May, Trump pulled his nomination of Ed Martin Jr. to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation&#x27;s capital, bowing to bipartisan concerns about the conservative activist&#x27;s modest legal experience and support for Jan. 6 rioters. And last month, the White House announced it would be withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni was supposed to succeed a BLS director who was fired following a disappointing jobs report.</p>
<p>According to texts viewed by Politico, Ingrassia told those in the chat that &quot;MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his &#x27;holiday&#x27; should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs.&quot; Politico also spoke to Ingrassia&#x27;s lawyer, who said the text messages might have been manipulated or were missing context. The lawyer did not confirm the texts were authentic.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Ingrassia&#x27;s texts, if authentic, were &quot;foul and disqualifying&quot; He said Trump should pull the nomination of Ingrassia, who works as the White House liaison for Homeland Security.</p>
<p>&quot;He should be fired from his current job within the administration,&quot; Schumer said after reading some of the text messages on the Senate floor. &quot;And he should never hold a position of leadership within the Republican Party or the government ever again.&quot;</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is scheduled to hear from Ingrassia on Thursday. It was unclear if anything on that front has changed with the panel&#x27;s chairman, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., saying &quot;we&#x27;re going to know more on Thursday.&quot;</p>
<p>The Office of Special Counsel is an investigative and prosecutorial office that works to protect government employees and whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. It&#x27;s also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers.</p>
<p>The office, now under the leadership of acting Director Jamieson Greer, confirmed in August that it was investigating former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith on allegations his investigation into Trump constituted political activity. Smith&#x27;s lawyers have said the investigation was &quot;wholly without merit,&quot; based on an &quot;imaginary and unfounded&quot; premise.</p>
<p>In May, Trump described Ingrassia in a social media post as a &quot;highly respected attorney, writer and Constitutional Scholar.&quot;</p>

<h2>WATCH LIVE: Trump marks Hindu holiday of Diwali with White House celebration</h2>

<p>NEW DELHI (AP) - Millions of Indians celebrated Diwali on Monday as lamps illuminated homes and streets across the country to mark the Hindu festival symbolizing the victory of light over darkness.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump will host a Diwali celebration on Tuesday, 4 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above.</p>
<p>Diwali, derived from the word &quot;Deepavali,&quot; meaning &quot;a row of lights,&quot; is typically celebrated by socializing and exchanging gifts. The dates of the festival are based on the Hindu lunar calendar, typically falling in late October or early November.</p>
<p>Shoppers crowded markets to buy flowers, lanterns and candles.</p>
<p>The celebrations were most visible in Ayodhya city in Uttar Pradesh state. Hindus believe the deity Lord Ram was born there and returned after 14 years in exile. People light earthen lamps to mark his homecoming.</p>
<p>As dusk fell Sunday, more than 2.6 million lamps were lit on the banks of the Saryu River in Ayodhya, retaining the Guinness World Record set last year. At least 2,100 Hindu priests performed prayers in unison, their chants echoing across the shimmering riverfront.</p>
<p>The holy city was also decked with fairy lights, and a laser and fireworks show illuminated its lanes and riverbanks. Thousands of residents lit lamps at houses and temples.</p>
<p>Officials said more than 33,000 volunteers helped light the lamps. Nearly 40 families from nearby villages produced 1.6 million lamps. At least 73,000 liters of oil and 5.5 million cotton wicks were used to light the city.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard work lighting diyas (oil lamps) one by one,&quot; said 19-year-old volunteer Rachit Singh, his face glowing in the firelight. &quot;But when you see the whole ghat (stairs to the river) light up, every bit of effort feels worth it.&quot;</p>
<p>In recent years, Diwali celebrations in New Delhi have been clouded by concerns over air pollution, as smoke-emitting firecrackers cause toxic smog that can take days to clear.</p>
<p>On Monday, the level of tiniest particulates surged to 347 on the air quality index in parts of the city - about 14 times the World Health Organization&#x27;s daily recommended maximum exposure - according to SAFAR, the federal government&#x27;s air quality monitoring agency.</p>
<p>Last week, India&#x27;s top court eased a blanket ban on firecrackers in New Delhi during Diwali, allowing limited use of &quot;green firecrackers&quot; that emit fewer pollutants. Developed by federal research institutes, they are designed to cut particulate and gas emissions by about 30%.</p>
<p>The court said they could be used during specific hours from Saturday to Tuesday.</p>

<h2>In Chicago, an immense show of force signals a sharp escalation in Trump immigration crackdown</h2>

<p>CHICAGO (AP) - The music begins low and ominous, with the video showing searchlights skimming along a Chicago apartment building and heavily armed immigration agents storming inside. Guns are drawn. Unmarked cars fill the streets. Agents rappel from a Black Hawk helicopter.</p>
<p>But quickly the soundtrack grows more stirring and the video - edited into a series of dramatic shots and released by the Department of Homeland Security days after the Sept. 30 raid - shows agents leading away shirtless men, their hands zip-tied behind their backs.</p>
<p>Authorities said they were targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, though they also said only two of the 27 immigrants arrested were gang members. They gave few details on the arrests.</p>
<p>But the apartments of dozens of U.S. citizens were targeted, residents said, and at least a half-dozen Americans were held for hours.</p>
<p>The immense show of force signaled a sharp escalation in the White House&#x27;s immigration crackdown and amplified tensions in a city already on edge.</p>
<p>&quot;To every criminal illegal alien: Darkness is no longer your ally,&quot; Homeland Security said in a social media post accompanying the video, which racked up more than 6.4 million views. &quot;We will find you.&quot;</p>
<p>But Tony Wilson, a third-floor resident born and raised on Chicago&#x27;s South Side, sees only horror in what happened.</p>
<p>&quot;It was like we were under attack,&quot; Wilson said days after the raid, speaking through the hole where his door knob used to be. Agents had used a grinder to cut out the deadbolt, and he still couldn&#x27;t close the door properly, let alone lock it. So he had barricaded himself inside, blocking the door with furniture.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t even hear them knock or nothing,&quot; said Wilson, a 58-year-old U.S. citizen on disability.</p>
<p>The raid was executed in the heart of South Shore, an overwhelmingly Black neighborhood on Lake Michigan that has long been a tangle of middle-class dreams, urban decay and gentrification.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a place where teams of drug dealers troll for customers outside ornate lakeside apartment buildings. It has some of the city&#x27;s best vegan restaurants but also takeout places where the catfish fillets are ordered through bullet-proof glass.</p>
<p>It has well-paid professors from the University of Chicago but is also where one-third of households scrape by on less than $25,000 a year.</p>
<p>The apartment building where the raid occurred has long been troubled. Five stories tall and built in the 1950s, residents said it was often strewn with garbage, the elevators rarely worked and crime was a constant worry. Things had grown more chaotic after dozens of Venezuelan migrants arrived in the past few years, residents said. While no residents said they felt threatened by the migrants, many described a rise in noise and hallway trash.</p>

<h2>Scientists discover how a high-fat keto diet could keep your brain young</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083646.htm'>Original</a> - None</em></p>

<p>Protecting your brain&#x27;s energy and keeping your mind sharp might start with what&#x27;s on your plate. Foods such as fish and seafood, meat, non-starchy vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, eggs, and even full-fat dairy may play a key role in maintaining cognitive health.</p>
<p>Exploring the Power of the Ketogenic Diet</p>
<p>At the University of Missouri, researchers are exploring how these foods influence brain function. Their work focuses on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan known as the ketogenic diet. Early results suggest that this approach could not only support long-term brain health but also slow or even prevent cognitive decline, especially among individuals who face a higher genetic risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</p>
<p>Inside the Roy Blunt NextGen Precision Health building, Ai-Ling Lin, a professor in the School of Medicine, and doctoral student Kira Ivanich are examining how the ketogenic diet may benefit people with the APOE4 gene, which is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</p>
<p>In their recent study using mice, Lin and Ivanich found that females with the APOE4 gene developed healthier gut bacteria and showed higher brain energy levels when following a ketogenic diet compared to those on a high-carbohydrate diet. Males did not show the same improvement, suggesting that gender may influence who benefits most from this dietary approach.</p>
<p>The key lies in how the brain produces its energy.</p>
<p>&quot;When we eat carbs, our brains convert the glucose into fuel for our brains, but those with the APOE4 gene -- particularly females -- struggle to convert the glucose into brain energy, and this can lead to cognitive decline down the road,&quot; Ivanich said. &quot;By switching to a keto diet, ketones are produced and used as an alternative fuel source. This may decrease the chance of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s by preserving the health of brain cells.&quot;</p>
<p>These findings highlight the potential of &quot;precision nutrition,&quot; an approach that adapts diets and interventions to fit a person&#x27;s unique biology.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of expecting one solution to work for everyone, it might be better to consider a variety of factors, including someone&#x27;s genotype, gut microbiome, gender and age,&quot; Lin said. &quot;Since the symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s -- which tend to be irreversible once they start -- usually appear after age 65, the time to be thinking about preserving brain health is well before then, so hopefully our research can offer hope to many people through early interventions.&quot;</p>
<p>Advancing Research Through Collaboration</p>
<p>Lin joined Mizzou in part for its collaborative environment and advanced imaging facilities located in the NextGen Precision Health building and at the University of Missouri Research Reactor.</p>
<p>&quot;We can do a lot of things in-house here that at other places we would have to outsource,&quot; Lin said. &quot;This is team science. The impact we make will be much better when we work together than by ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>With cutting-edge imaging equipment and both research and clinical spaces under the same roof, the NextGen Precision Health building allows Mizzou to move quickly from preclinical models to human trials.</p>
<p>For Ivanich, that real-world impact is personal.</p>
<p>&quot;When my grandmother got Alzheimer&#x27;s, that sparked my interest in this topic, so being able to make an impact to help people preserve their brain health is very rewarding,&quot; she said. &quot;With Mizzou being a leading research university and having a tight-knit community feel, I know I&#x27;m at the right place.&quot;</p>

<h2>This simple innovation could change blood pressure testing forever</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083644.htm'>Original</a> - None</em></p>

<p>A newly developed method that improves the accuracy of ankle blood pressure measurements could transform care for people who are unable to have their blood pressure taken from the arm.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Exeter Medical School, in a study published in BMJ Open and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), analyzed data from more than 33,000 individuals to create a personalized predictive model. This model enables healthcare professionals to estimate arm blood pressure more precisely using ankle readings (when compared with earlier approaches). To make the process easier to use, the team has also launched an online calculator that helps both clinicians and patients interpret ankle-based results.</p>
<p>Why Accuracy in Blood Pressure Measurement Matters</p>
<p>More than one billion people worldwide live with high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. Reliable measurements are crucial for diagnosing and managing the condition effectively.</p>
<p>Although blood pressure is typically measured on the upper arm, some people cannot have it taken there due to disability, limb loss, or conditions such as stroke. In such cases, readings are taken from the ankle. However, ankle measurements are usually higher than arm readings, and because treatment guidelines are based on arm data, this difference can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate treatment decisions.</p>
<p>Improving Accuracy and Reducing Misdiagnoses</p>
<p>Professor Chris Clark, who led the research, explained: &quot;Our new method will give a more accurate blood pressure reading for around two percent more people. This doesn&#x27;t sound a big number but remember, around a third of adults have high blood pressure and once you get into your 60s it&#x27;s more than half of the adults. The NHS Health Check Programme diagnoses 38,000 new cases annually in England alone, so two percent equates to 750 fewer potential misdiagnoses per year in England, and tens of thousands globally.&quot;</p>
<p>To achieve this, the researchers used statistical modeling on data from 33,710 people (mean age 58 years, 45 per cent female) across multiple countries. The analysis explored the relationship between arm and ankle blood pressures, developed a predictive equation for estimating arm values from ankle readings, and examined how ankle readings relate to important health outcomes (such as heart attack risk).</p>
<p>This advancement could help close a significant health gap by providing accurate and personalized blood pressure results for people who have been excluded from standard monitoring. It is estimated that up to 10,000 adults in the UK live with upper limb loss, while 75 per cent of the country&#x27;s 1.3 million stroke survivors experience upper limb difficulties that can make arm-based measurements challenging or impossible.</p>
<p>The project received support from the Stroke Association and the Thalidomide Trust, two organizations advocating for people affected by these conditions.</p>
<p>Expert Reactions and Public Health Impact</p>
<p>Juliet Bouverie OBE, CEO of the Stroke Association, said: &quot;Someone in the UK has a stroke every five minutes, with high blood pressure accounting for around half of those. Around two-thirds of stroke survivors will leave hospital with some form of disability, including paralysis in an arm, which can prevent getting accurate blood pressure readings from the affected limb. Many stroke survivors feel anxious about having another stroke, so receiving an accurate blood pressure reading in the ankle will not only provide benefits in the primary prevention of stroke, but importantly in easing the minds of stroke survivors who are already dealing with the devastating impact of stroke.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Kevin Munro, Director of NIHR&#x27;s Research for Patient Benefit Programme, said: &quot;This research has identified an ingenious solution to an important problem -- finding a way to measure blood pressure for people who cannot have it monitored via the upper arm. Keeping track of blood pressure is a vital tool to help keep people healthy and this NIHR-funded research will help to spot high blood pressure and treat it even more widely.&quot;</p>

<h2>Scientists stumble on a hidden quantum trick in 2D materials</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083640.htm'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_4dec8bd33015.webp'></p>
<p>When arranged in just the right ways, two-dimensional materials can display unusual and valuable quantum effects such as superconductivity and exotic types of magnetism. Understanding why these effects arise, and how to control them, remains one of the biggest challenges for physicists and engineers. A new study published in Nature Physics has uncovered a previously unseen property that may explain how these mysterious quantum phases form and evolve.</p>
<p>Using a novel terahertz (THz) spectroscopy method, researchers found that thin stacks of 2D materials -- commonly used in laboratories worldwide -- can naturally create what are called cavities. These tiny spaces confine both light and electrons into even smaller regions, significantly altering their interactions and behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve uncovered a hidden layer of control in quantum materials and opened a path to shaping light-matter interactions in ways that could help us both understand exotic phases of matter and ultimately harness them for future quantum technologies,&quot; said James McIver, assistant professor of physics at Columbia and lead author of the paper.</p>
<p>The work traces its origins to Hamburg, where McIver led a research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD). The institute is part of the Max Planck-New York Center on Nonequilibrium Quantum Phenomena, a collaboration among MPSD, Columbia, the Flatiron Institute, and Cornell University. Researchers at the Center study how stable physical systems respond when pushed away from equilibrium.</p>
<p>McIver&#x27;s team explores these questions through light. &quot;2D materials, with their fascinating macroscopic properties, often behave like black boxes. By shining light on them, we can literally shed light on the hidden behavior of their electrons, revealing details that would otherwise remain unseen,&quot; said Gunda Kipp, a PhD student at MPSD and first author of the paper. One obstacle, however, is that the wavelengths of light needed to probe 2D materials are far larger than the materials themselves, which are thinner than a human hair.</p>
<p>To overcome this scale mismatch, the researchers developed a chip-sized spectroscope that compresses THz light -- the range where many quantum effects occur -- from about 1 millimeter down to just 3 micrometers. This compact design made it possible to directly observe how electrons move within 2D materials. They first tested their approach using graphene, a well-known form of carbon, to measure its optical conductivity.</p>
<p>What they found was unexpected: distinct standing waves.</p>
<p>&quot;Light can couple to electrons to form hybrid light-matter quasiparticles. These quasiparticles move as waves and, under certain conditions, they can become confined, much like the standing wave on a guitar string that produces a distinct note,&quot; explained MPSD postdoctoral fellow and co-first-author Hope Bretscher.</p>
<p>In a guitar, the string&#x27;s fixed ends define where the wave can form. Pressing a finger on the string shortens the wave, changing the pitch of the note. In optics, a similar process occurs when two mirrors trap light between them, creating a standing wave inside what scientists call a cavity. When a material is placed inside that cavity, the trapped light can repeatedly interact with it, altering its electronic properties.</p>
<p>However, the researchers discovered that mirrors might not even be necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;We found that the material&#x27;s own edges already act as mirrors,&quot; said Kipp. With their THz spectroscope, they observed that excited streams of electrons reflect off the edges to form a type of hybrid light-matter quasiparticle called a plasmon polariton.</p>
<p>The McIver lab studied a device made up of multiple layers, each of which can act as a cavity separated by a few tens of nanometers. The plasmons that form in each layer can, in turn, interact -- often strongly. &quot;It&#x27;s like connecting two guitar strings; once linked, the note changes,&quot; said Bretscher. &quot;In our case, it changes drastically.&quot;</p>
<p>The next step was to understand what determines the frequencies of these quasiparticles and how tightly light and matter couple together. &quot;With co-author and MPSD postdoctoral fellow Marios Michael, we developed an analytical theory that only needed a handful of geometric sample parameters to match the observations of our experiments,&quot; said Kipp. &quot;With just a click of a button, our theory can extract the properties of a material and will help us design and tailor future samples to obtain specific properties. For example, by tracking resonances as functions of carrier density, temperature, or magnetic field, we may uncover the mechanisms driving different quantum phases.&quot;</p>
<p>While this study focused on plasmons, the new chip-scale THz spectroscope could detect other types of quasiparticles oscillating in many different 2D materials. The team is already testing new samples in both Hamburg and New York.</p>
<p>&quot;This whole project was a bit of a serendipitous discovery. We didn&#x27;t expect to see</p>

<h2> We may already know what&#x27;s turning iPhone 17 Pro pink, and Apple&#x27;s iPhone cleaning guidance is the key </h2>
<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/we-may-already-know-whats-turning-iphone-17-pro-pink-and-apples-iphone-cleaning-guidance-is-the-key'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_1fb08cd43746.svg'></p>
<p>Sometimes the easiest explanation is the most obvious</p>
<p>If you believe the reports and images on Reddit, there are some iPhone 17 Pro Cosmic Orange phones that are inexplicably turning pink. There aren&#x27;t many reported cases, but enough that some have already coined the term &quot;Colorgate.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s fun to have a new &quot;gate&quot; to consider, but what if there&#x27;s a simple, scientific explanation for these potential color shifts and the answer has been staring us in the face from one of Apple&#x27;s own support pages all along?</p>
<p>First, we reviewed the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max here and have yet to experience any fading. Even scratchgate hasn&#x27;t reached our new iPhones yet, but the hue and cry surrounding this new issue is such that it&#x27;s worth investigating.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s start by stepping back to understand the iPhone 17 Pro&#x27;s (and 17 Pro Max) finish, the process by which it&#x27;s made, and how it differs from the iPhone 16 Pro line&#x27;s titanium finish.</p>
<p>Titanium is a heavier, stronger metal than aluminum, and when it&#x27;s anodized (an electrochemical process), it adopts a smooth, non-porous finish. Anodizing aluminum, on the other hand, results in a porous finish that can be bathed in a special dye that soaks color into those pores and then is specially sealed.</p>
<p>Those differences in materials and the process by which the iPhone 17 Pro chassis is made allow for the richer iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max colors: Cosmic Orange and Deep Blue.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, Cosmic Orange has turned out to be the more popular color, which may account for the number of reports. But how might that lovely orange fade to an almost equally attractive reddish pink?</p>
<p>Oddly, a partial answer might be found here on this 2013 PF Finishing Products post by Mark Jazefowicz, VP of Technical Services, Reliant Aluminum Products. In it, Jazefowicz writes:</p>
<p>&quot;Color anodized aluminum is widely used as a material in the medical device industry. From tool handles to trays, these repeat-use devices undergo regular cleaning and sterilization treatments, and it is vital that the original finish remain preserved throughout.</p>
<p>Several types of sterilization methods are in use today, but those that incorporate hydrogen peroxide injection are particularly challenging for a color anodized finish to endure, since fading or significant discoloration typically occurs after only a few sterizliation cycles.&quot;</p>
<p>So, according to Jazefowicz, hydrogen peroxide, a chemical that&#x27;s occasionally used to bleach hair, is no friend to an anodized aluminum finish color.</p>
<p>If we needed more evidence, we need only look at Apple&#x27;s own guidance for iPhone cleaning.</p>
<p>Yes, 70% isopropyl alcohol is okay, as is a 75% ethyl alcohol wipe. Even Clorox Disinfecting Wipes pass muster when used gently. But the language is crystal clear: &quot;Don&#x27;t use products containing bleach or hydrogen peroxide.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple isn&#x27;t explaining here why you should never use those solvents, but based on the information from that decade-old-plus article, we can guess why.</p>

<h2> TikTok owner is collaborating with AMD, Arm, and Intel on making firmware solutions better - ByteDance is the only Chinese company participating in this major project </h2>

<p>OpenSFI layers above AMD&#x27;s openSIL and Intel&#x27;s FSP for unified function calls</p>
<p>A new collaboration between leading chipmakers and cloud firms will bring together AMD, Arm, Intel, Google, ByteDance, Microsoft, MiTAC, HPE, and others to create a more unified firmware foundation.</p>
<p>The initiative, known as openSFI (Open Silicon Firmware Interface), seeks to define a single, architecture-neutral interface for how host firmware communicates with CPU silicon during initialization and operation.</p>
<p>The project is notable for its broad membership, as ByteDance stands out as the only Chinese participant among American and European technology giants.</p>
<p>The openSFI project builds upon and complements AMD&#x27;s ongoing openSIL effort, which aims to replace the proprietary AGESA codebase for silicon initialization with a transparent, open-source alternative.</p>
<p>Within this new structure, openSFI acts as a unified layer sitting atop AMD&#x27;s openSIL and Intel&#x27;s FSP (Firmware Support Package).</p>
<p>In effect, it serves as a shared abstraction point that lets host firmware call standardized functions without concern for the underlying silicon vendor.</p>
<p>This approach could streamline platform development, reduce redundant engineering, and allow firmware to be reused across different CPUs.</p>
<p>The published openSFI 0.3 specification lays out the project&#x27;s design principles and integration model, noting its goal is to, &quot;enable modular, scalable, and vendor-agnostic integration of silicon into host firmware environments.&quot;</p>
<p>The specification emphasizes a stable API contract for host firmware to call silicon initialization functions predictably and consistently.</p>
<p>It also outlines the primary objectives of openSFI: unifying silicon initialization interfaces, simplifying firmware integration, and promoting reusability between vendors to cut validation costs and improve sustainability.</p>
<p>ByteDance&#x27;s involvement is notable in a field often dominated by Western and Japanese semiconductor firms.</p>
<p>By joining openSFI, ByteDance opens an unusual level of engagement between a Chinese tech firm and major U.S. semiconductor companies.</p>
<p>Although the ambition is promising, there is no information on how openSFI will be adopted across competing hardware ecosystems.</p>
<p>Previous attempts at firmware standardization have struggled due to differing vendor interests and evolving hardware platforms.</p>

<p>With Windows 10 hitting EOL, Windows 11 is set to become the AI OS</p>
<p>Now Windows 10 has reached its end-of-life, Microsoft has released more information on its future plans surrounding Windows 11, primarily concerning its commitment to turning the operating system &#x27;AI-native&#x27;.</p>
<p>With Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot AI &#x27;companion&#x27;, the organization wants to push users towards a fully integrated agentic AI experience - with AI no longer just being an &#x27;add on&#x27; tool to the OS, but rather a core part of Windows.</p>
<p>&quot;Windows leads the AI-native shift,&quot; said Stefan Kinnestrand, Vice President at Microsoft. &quot;Windows is evolving into an AI-native platform: secure, scalable, and built for agentic work,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>Copilot+ PCs will be on the hardware side of this commitment, with AI features on the software side, as Microsoft hints new &quot;breakthrough performance and native AI experiences&quot; are set to be arriving soon for Windows 11 users, but only those who already own a Copilot+ PC at first.</p>
<p>&quot;Windows is evolving to more effectively empower organizations to innovate, adapt, and thrive in a rapidly changing business landscape driven by AI &quot; Kinnestrand added.</p>
<p>&quot;With the latest AI features, organizations gain an enterprise-grade foundation where AI powered capabilities operate safely and effectively, unlocking new levels of productivity and business agility.&quot;</p>
<p>But what will this mean for users? Well, it means Copilot will be weaved into PCs with Windows 11, rather than pushing customers to purchase specific Copilot Plus PCs.</p>
<p>Microsoft wants its customers to communicate and work with their PC - out loud.</p>
<p>Workers will also soon get access to new Copilot Voice, Vision, and Action features. Copilot Voice enables voice commands to search, automate tasks, and &#x27;make daily work more intuitive and hands-free&#x27; - whilst Copilot Vision allows the AI access to your screen in real-time and offers analysis and provides instructions on using apps or completing tasks - both &#x27;opt-in permissions&#x27;.</p>
<p>Copilot Action will let Copilot agents perform tasks on the users behalf. Examples Microsoft have given are; &#x27;opening apps, changing settings, or starting workflows-based on context and intent&#x27; - not entirely ground breaking.</p>
<p>Despite all these features, Windows 11 and AI are &#x27;designed to make technology feel invisible, so employees can focus on what matters&#x27; Kinnestrand argues.</p>
<p>The Microsoft ecosystem with fully integrated technology is aimed at helping &#x27;reduce complexity, unlock cross-platform intelligence, and deliver seamless experiences across teams and tools.&#x27;</p>
<p>Finally, there&#x27;s &#x27;Click to Do&#x27;, a productivity tool which Microsoft says will empower users to &#x27;act instantly, such as scheduling meetings or launching tasks, directly from their workspace,&#x27; with workflows streamlined through a single click.</p>

<p>Cameron Norrie made it to the semi-finals of Wimbledon in 2022</p>
<p>Britain&#x27;s Cameron Norrie battled his way to victory over seventh seed Andrey Rublev to progress to the second round of the Erste Bank Open.</p>
<p>World number 35 Norrie won the two-hour match 6-2 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 in Austria.</p>
<p>Norrie, 30, started the match in fine fashion and took the opening set in just 34 minutes before breaking serve to move 2-0 up in the second.</p>
<p>The Briton served for the match at 5-4, but Rublev landed his first break of serve to force a tie-break, which he won to set up a deciding set.</p>
<p>Former world number eight Norrie regrouped to break Rublev&#x27;s serve in the second game to take command of the third set.</p>
<p>Norrie broke once more to book his spot in the next round, where he will face either Australia&#x27;s Alexei Popyrin or Italy&#x27;s Matteo Berrettini.</p>
<p>&quot;It was all round a really good performance, I was moving well and able to dictate the points,&quot; said Norrie.</p>
<p>&quot;I got a bit tight and tentative when I was serving for the match but credit to him staying in and competing.&quot;</p>

<h2>Sinner to miss Italy&#x27;s Davis Cup title defence</h2>

<p>Jannik Sinner was world number one until losing the US Open final to Carlos Alcaraz in September</p>
<p>Four-time Grand Slam champion Jannik Sinner will not be part of the Italy team aiming to clinch a third consecutive Davis Cup title next month.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old reached all four Grand Slam singles finals in 2025, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and won the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Saudi Arabia on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sinner is scheduled to take part in the ATP Tour Finals in Turin from 9-16 November, but Italy captain Filippo Volandri said the world number two had &quot;not given his availability&quot; to play at the Davis Cup in Bologna from 18-23 November.</p>
<p>World number one Carlos Alcaraz has been named in Spain&#x27;s team.</p>
<p>Sinner dominates Alcaraz at lucrative Six Kings Slam</p>
<p>&#x27;Sport must adapt&#x27;, says Draper after Rune injury</p>
<p>Sinner says he has taken the decision to miss the Davis Cup so he can have extra preparation time for the start of next season, with the Australian Open being the first Grand Slam of the year in January.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t an easy decision, but after Turin, the goal is to get off on the right foot in Australia,&quot; Sinner told Sky Sport Italy. &quot;It may not seem like it, but a week of preparation during that period can make all the difference.</p>
<p>&quot;We won the Davis Cup in 2023 and 2024, and this time we decided this with my team.&quot;</p>
<p>Lorenzo Musetti and Flavio Cobolli, eighth and 22nd in the world respectively, will be the highest-ranked singles players on show for Italy, who face Austria in their quarter-final.</p>
<p>Volandri said: &quot;The Davis Cup is, and will remain, always his home and I am sure that Jannik will soon be part of the team again.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime, I can count on a group ready to fight and give everything for the blue jersey.&quot;</p>
<p>Sinner&#x27;s absence comes after several players voiced concerns about a demanding tennis calendar in recent weeks.</p>
<p>After Holger Rune sustained a season-ending injury at the Nordic Open on Saturday, British number one Jack Draper posted on social media that &quot;the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity&quot;.</p>

<h2>Second seed Rosatello out on day one of Wrexham Open</h2>

<p>Camilla Rosatello has won two doubles titles on the WTA Challenger Tour</p>
<p>Venue: Wrexham Tennis and Padel Centre Date: 21-26 October</p>
<p>Coverage: Watch live on BBC Sport online and BBC iPlayer</p>
<p>Italy&#x27;s second seed Camilla Rosatello was knocked out in the opening match of the Wrexham Open by Slovakia&#x27;s Katarina Kuzmova.</p>
<p>Rosatello dropped the first set but bounced back to win the second on a tie-break to force a deciding set.</p>
<p>However, the 30-year-old was broken early in that final set by Kuzmova, and went on to lose 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (4-7) 6-4.</p>
<p>There was to be no such problem for fourth seed Kathinka von Deichmann of Liechtenstein or fifth seed Raluca Georgiana Serban of Cyprus.</p>
<p>Serban was forced to do things the hard way, however, after dropping the first set against Great Britain&#x27;s Ranah Akua Stoiber.</p>
<p>Serban responded by racing through the second set, and while Stoiber forced a tie-break in the decider, the 28-year-old Cypriot would go on to win 1-6 6-0 7-6 (7-5).</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the first round of the women&#x27;s singles there were straight-set wins for Jana Otzipka, Elena Malygina, Amarni Banks and Lucie Havlickova, while Andre Lukosiute progressed after winning a deciding set against Gina Marie Dittmann.</p>
<p>Mimi Xu was beaten by Emma Raducanu in the first round of the women&#x27;s singles at Wimbledon this year</p>
<p>The home crowd in attendance in Wrexham on the opening day were firmly behind Welsh 18-year-old Mimi Xu in the first round of the women&#x27;s doubles.</p>
<p>Xu and McDonald continued their dominance into the second set, and dropped just two further games on the way to completing a 6-3 6-2 win in north Wales.</p>
<p>They will face third seeds Naima Karamoko of Switzerland and Jessika Ponchet of France in the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Ponchet and Karamoko cruised through 6-0 6-1 against Britain&#x27;s Georgiana Mititelu and Elizabeth Evans.</p>

<h2>Back to basics, winning back fans &amp; Clough&#x27;s dog - Dyche&#x27;s Forest return</h2>

<p>Sean Dyche has signed a deal with Nottingham Forest until summer 2027</p>
<p>New Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche wants his under-performing stars to reconnect with disillusioned supporters.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old became Forest&#x27;s third manager in six weeks when he replaced Ange Postecoglou on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Postecoglou was dismissed 39 days after he came in for the sacked Nuno Espirito Santo on 9 September.</p>
<p>Former Tottenham boss Postecoglou struggled to win over supporters, who chanted he would be &quot;sacked in the morning&quot; during a 3-2 Europa League defeat by Midtjylland last month.</p>
<p>Dyche came through the Forest academy in the 1980s, although he never made a first-team appearance, and is eager to unify the City Ground.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to get back on the front foot, in old football terminology, and hopefully give the crowd something to cheer about and reconnect,&quot; Dyche told BBC Radio Nottingham.</p>
<p>&quot;The Forest fans in my experience have been very fair down the years and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s far away from the team reconnecting. The first thing is performances, get them back on that winning edge they have shown.&quot;</p>
<p>Is Dyche the right man to repair Forest?</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest appoint Dyche as new manager</p>
<p>Inside Postecoglou&#x27;s 39 days to forget at Forest</p>
<p>Forest finished seventh in the Premier League last season under Nuno, their highest placing for 30 years, but they sit 18th and have not won since the opening day of this campaign.</p>
<p>They face Porto in the Europa League in Dyche&#x27;s first game on Thursday before travelling to Bournemouth on Sunday.</p>
<p>Forest have not kept a clean sheet for 20 games, since beating Manchester United in April. They will host United at the City Ground on 1 November.</p>
<p>&quot;The basics have always got to be in place,&quot; said Dyche.</p>

<p>How do you improve a stellar veteran team who have won back-to-back promotions, including a league-cup double featuring 30 wins from 32 games?</p>
<p>Recruit a raft of former professionals who have played at the highest level of club and international football as you target more silverware.</p>
<p>Manchester club Wythenshawe AFC, external have an amateur vets team with nine former Premier League players in their current squad.</p>
<p>BBC Sport takes a closer look at the Sunday league dream team.</p>
<p>Wythenshawe Vets Over-35s are based in south Manchester and play in the Cheshire Vets League Premier Division.</p>
<p>Their squad list this season boasts nine former Premier League players, with a combined 1,801 top-flight appearances.</p>
<p>The elite roster also contains 222 Premier League goals and 325 international caps.</p>
<p>They include Papiss Cisse, who scored 37 goals in 117 appearances for Newcastle United after joining for Â£9m from Bundesliga side Freiburg in January 2012.</p>
<p>Cisse made his debut for Wythenshawe in their last home game against reigning champions Collegiate Old Boys and scored all six goals in a 6-2 win - including a 32-minute first-half hat-trick.</p>
<p>Wythenshawe&#x27;s squad for this season also includes former pros such as England and Liverpool striker Emile Heskey, Hull and Burnley winger George Boyd, Everton striker Oumar Niasse, Wigan full-back Maynor Figueroa, Manchester City duo Stephen Ireland and Nedum Onuoha and Premier League title winners Joleon Lescott and Danny Drinkwater.</p>
<p>Collectively, the former top-flight players have won 15 major trophies and moved for combined transfer fees of about Â£123m.</p>
<p>Stephen Ireland won six Republic of Ireland caps, scoring four goals</p>
<p>Ireland began playing for the team during pre-season this summer through close friend and current Wythenshawe player Blake Norton, and the former Republic of Ireland midfielder then invited other ex-pros, who all play in a midweek nine-a-side game, to join in.</p>
<p>Former Senegal forward Niasse, who scored 12 goals in 65 Premier League games for Everton and still attends their home games, also made his debut against Collegiate OB - who are based in Liverpool and wear an Everton training kit as their strip.</p>

<h2>Winning &amp; togetherness - Rohl sets out Rangers mission</h2>

<p>Danny Rohl has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Rangers</p>
<p>Danny Rohl delivered a simple message as he was introduced as Rangers head coach: &quot;We want to win.&quot;</p>
<p>The German, 36, has replaced Russell Martin, who left Ibrox after 17 games, only five of which were victories.</p>
<p>Rangers trail Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts by 13 points and defending champions Celtic by eight.</p>
<p>In the Europa League, Martin oversaw defeats in Rangers&#x27; opening two league phase fixtures.</p>
<p>&quot;We know where we are at the moment,&quot; said Rohl. &quot;We want to win, we need wins because we want to turn around the position at the moment. We are not happy.</p>
<p>&quot;I looked for a club to win titles and this club has everything for all these goals. It&#x27;s amazing to be part of here.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x27;Rohl jumps from Wednesday frying pan into Rangers furnace&#x27;</p>
<p>What awaits new Rangers manager Rohl?</p>
<p>&#x27;I see so much potential&#x27; - Rohl introduced as Rangers head coach</p>
<p>Rohl gave an insight into his tactical approach, with Rangers having struggled defensively this term and also been blunt in attack.</p>
<p>&quot;My focus is on my person, what I can bring to this football club,&quot; the former Sheffield Wednesday boss said. &quot;I see so much potential.</p>
<p>&quot;My football, what I want to see on the pitch is intensity, it&#x27;s sprinting, it&#x27;s a togetherness and a playing forward style because we want to create chances, we want to create goals.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to speed up our game. We want to attack the last line. If you do it again, we create more chances and we have more goals.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to defend as a group, as a unit much, much better with a lot of aggression in the duels.</p>

<h2>Plans for Trump-Putin meeting shelved days after Budapest talks proposed</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjp73gp41o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_f3eea701d9d1.webp'></p>
<p>Last Thursday Trump said he and the Russian president would hold talks in Budapest within two weeks to discuss the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov was due to be held this week - but the White House said the two had had a &quot;productive&quot; call and that a meeting was no longer &quot;necessary&quot;.</p>
<p>The White House did not share any more details on why the talks had been put on hold.</p>
<p>But key differences between US proposals and Russia&#x27;s preconditions for peace became increasingly clear this week, and appear to have dashed chances of a summit between the two presidents.</p>
<p>Trump had discussed a Budapest summit over the phone with Putin, a day before meeting Ukraine&#x27;s Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House.</p>
<p>Some reports suggested his talks with Zelensky had been a &quot;shouting match&quot;, with sources suggesting Trump had pushed him to give up large areas of territory in eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known as the Donbas, as part of a deal with Russia.</p>
<p>However, Zelensky has always said Ukraine cannot relinquish the parts of the Donbas it still holds, on the grounds that Russia could later use the area as a springboard for further attacks.</p>
<p>On Monday, Trump embraced a ceasefire proposal backed by Kyiv and European leaders to freeze the conflict on the current front line.</p>
<p>&quot;Let it be cut the way it is,&quot; he said. &quot;I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia has repeatedly pushed back against freezing the current line of contact.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that &quot;the consistency of Russia&#x27;s position doesn&#x27;t change&quot; - referring to Moscow&#x27;s insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.</p>
<p>Moscow was only interested in &quot;long-term, sustainable peace&quot;, Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.</p>
<p>The &quot;root causes of the conflict&quot; needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine - a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, European leaders put out a statement with Zelensky saying that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line and accused Russia of not being &quot;serious&quot; about peace.</p>
<p>Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August during a hastily organised summit which yielded no concrete results.</p>

<h2>Boris Johnson left the Covid Inquiry in a hurry - he&#x27;ll be pleased not to come back</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6nennz0nyo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_ee71a2aab1a8.webp'></p>
<p>Papers in hand, Boris Johnson arrived at the Covid Inquiry before the sun came up.</p>
<p>He was there to answer questions on decisions he made during the pandemic that directly impacted children.</p>
<p>School attendance, behaviour, screen time, speech and language - we now know the pandemic had an enduring effect on all of these issues for children.</p>
<p>Demand for speech and language support increased markedly after the pandemic. The amount of children who are persistently absent from school is still stubbornly high. And school suspensions and exclusions have hit record levels.</p>
<p>Each of these issues can be traced back to a part of the pandemic which has been central to this session of the inquiry: the closure of schools.</p>
<p>The decision to shut schools was one described by Boris Johnson on Tuesday as a &quot;personal horror&quot; for him, a &quot;nightmare idea&quot;, but one which he also said seemed like the only option at the time.</p>
<p>We know that, in March 2020, the government was still maintaining an almost total focus on efforts to keep schools open.</p>
<p>But last week the former education secretary Gavin Williamson told the inquiry ministers should have &quot;bitten the bullet&quot; and done more to prepare for school closures.</p>
<p>We heard in earlier evidence given to the inquiry that there wasn&#x27;t even a plan for the closure of schools until the day before it was announced on 18 March 2020.</p>
<p>This was described as an &quot;extraordinary dereliction of duty&quot; in the evidence of Sir Jon Coles, chief executive of the United Learning trust.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, the former PM pushed back on that claim.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the sequence from February onwards, it&#x27;s clear that Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) is talking about the possibility, the Cabinet is discussing it in March. Certainly I remember the subject coming up repeatedly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It is right to say Sage had referenced the prospect of &quot;mass school closures&quot; in February 2020.</p>
<p>But the top civil servant at the Department for Education (DfE) at the time, Jonathan Slater, wrote in his evidence submitted to the inquiry that &quot;DfE&#x27;s contingency plans were premised on the assumption that schools (and other education settings) would remain open&quot;.</p>
<p>And Williamson told the inquiry last week that his ability to plan for closures was impeded by Downing Street.</p>

<h2>Gaza ceasefire deal going better than expected, Vance says</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9k2dj37wqo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_478450652bc1.webp'></p>
<p>The implementation of a Gaza ceasefire agreement is &quot;going better than expected&quot; and the truce can hold, US Vice-President JD Vance has said during a visit to Israel.</p>
<p>Vance also warned that &quot;if Hamas does not co-operate, it will be obliterated&quot;, while refusing to give a deadline for when the Palestinian group must disarm - a part of US proposals yet to be agreed.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump, who brokered the ceasefire deal earlier this month, said America&#x27;s &quot;great allies&quot; in the Middle East would be ready to &quot;go into Gaza with a heavy force and &#x27;straighten out Hamas&#x27; if Hamas continues to act badly&quot;.</p>
<p>Vance&#x27;s visits come after a flare-up of violence on Sunday that threatened to derail the 12-day-old truce.</p>
<p>Israel said a Hamas attack killed two soldiers, triggering Israeli air strikes which killed dozens of Palestinians.</p>
<p>Trump wrote on social media that &quot;there is still hope that Hamas will do what is right&quot;, adding: &quot;If they do not, an end to Hamas will be FAST, FURIOUS, &amp; BRUTAL!&quot;</p>
<p>Vance is expected to push Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to start negotiations on long-term issues for a permanent end to the war with Hamas during his visit.</p>
<p>The vice-president praised Israel for being &quot;remarkably helpful&quot; in moving towards the deal&#x27;s main goals, but said that a lot of hard work remained ahead to secure further steps.</p>
<p>The two special US envoys who helped negotiate the ceasefire deal, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, appeared alongside Vance at a news briefing in southern Israel.</p>
<p>Witkoff and Kushner held talks with Netanyahu after arriving in Israel on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump is said to have dispatched his deputy and envoys to Israel to keep up the momentum and push for the start of talks on the second critical phase of his 20-point Gaza peace plan.</p>
<p>It would involve setting up an interim government in the Palestinian territory, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.</p>
<p>Israel has previously said it would not join such talks until Hamas has returned all the deceased hostages it has been holding.</p>
<p>Vance, Witkoff and Kushner are also attempting to ensure the ceasefire deal, which is based on the first phase of the peace plan, does not collapse first.</p>
<p>Netanyahu told the Israeli parliament on Monday that he would discuss &quot;security challenges&quot; and &quot;political opportunities&quot; with Vance during his visit.</p>

<h2>Hermès appoint British designer to lead menswear</h2>

<p>British designer Grace Wales Bonner has been named as the new creative director of menswear for French fashion house Hermès.</p>
<p>The appointment means Wales Bonner, a 35-year-old Londoner, is now the first black woman to lead design at a major fashion house, according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>In a statement, Wales Bonner said she was &quot;deeply honoured to be entrusted with the role&quot;.</p>
<p>She replaces Véronique Nichanian, who has been the company&#x27;s artistic director of menswear division for 37 years.</p>
<p>Her final collection for the brand will be shown in Paris in January, while Wales Bonner&#x27;s first collection will launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In her statement, Wales Bonner said: &quot;It is a dream realised to embark on this new chapter, following in a lineage of inspired craftspeople and designers.&quot;</p>
<p>She also thanked the company&#x27;s bosses &quot;for the opportunity to bring my vision to this magical house&quot;.</p>
<p>Reporting the news on Tuesday, Vogue said: &quot;While industry insiders were betting on a promotion from within, Hermès went for a renowned talent.&quot;</p>
<p>Wales Bonner, who was born in London to an English mother and Jamaican father, founded her own label in 2014, not long after graduating from London&#x27;s Central Saint Martins College of Art.</p>
<p>According to Vogue, Wales Bonner will continue her namesake brand alongside her new Hermès role.</p>
<p>She dressed F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, musician FKA Twigs, and actor Jeff Goldblum for this year&#x27;s Met Gala and has made T-shirts with musician Solange Knowles, younger sister of Beyoncé.</p>
<p>Wales Bonner has also curated an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and hosted musical performances at London&#x27;s Serpentine Galleries.</p>
<p>She has had a long-standing collaboration with Adidas and was made a MBE in 2022 for services to fashion.</p>
<p>Pierre-Alexis Dumas, general artistic director of Hermès, said: &quot;I am really pleased to welcome Grace to the Hermès artistic director family.</p>
<p>&quot;Her take on contemporary fashion, craft and culture will contribute to shaping Hermès men&#x27;s style, melding the house&#x27;s heritage with a confident look on the now.</p>

<p>Bad Boy Chiller Crew forgive anyone who forgot about them.</p>
<p>The trio&#x27;s brand of Bradford bassline earned them a UK top 10 single with BMW in 2022.</p>
<p>And their first album, Disrespectful, would have made number one if Ed Sheeran&#x27;s = (Equals) hadn&#x27;t got in its way.</p>
<p>By 2023 Gareth &quot;GK&quot; Kelly, Kane Welsh and Sam &quot;Clive&quot; Robinson were riding high, nominated for group of the year at the Brits alongside The 1975 and Arctic Monkeys.</p>
<p>Just as they were building momentum, they tell BBC Newsbeat, they were forced to hit pause when a legal dispute erupted with record label House Anxiety.</p>
<p>Unable to release new tracks, they swapped making music for combing through contracts. Kane says it was like &quot;jogging on the spot&quot;.</p>
<p>In July, a judge confirmed that a deal between the band and the record label had expired.</p>
<p>The group admit they&#x27;d considered going their separate ways during their hiatus.</p>
<p>&quot;I was ready to give it up,&quot; GK tells Newsbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn&#x27;t earn a living. What we had left got thrown into solicitor and court fees.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the worst time of our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Kane says it&#x27;s a relief to share music they&#x27;ve had ready and waiting on hard drives for months.</p>
<p>&quot;We were putting all this work and effort in, eight hours a day, making music that we couldn&#x27;t even release,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>GK adds: &quot;But what we&#x27;re trying to do is bring the old sound back.&quot;</p>
<p>The band are drip-feeding fans remixes of songs from their breakthrough mixtape, Full Wack No Breaks.</p>

<h2>Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now</h2>

<p>The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair&#x27;s tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.</p>
<p>Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears&#x27;s allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.</p>
<p>Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.</p>
<p>Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book&#x27;s release by publisher Listenin.</p>
<p>He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.</p>
<p>When they were teenagers, the couple&#x27;s sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. &quot;They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - &#x27;Oh, you&#x27;re awake?&#x27; - with a knife in her hand,&quot; he writes. &quot;Then she&#x27;d turn around and pad off without explanation.&quot;</p>
<p>Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: &quot;The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it&#x27;s racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we&#x27;re getting close to the 11th hour.&quot;</p>
<p>He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears&#x27;s life were controlled by others for years, and described it as a &quot;lifeline&quot; in its early days.</p>
<p>He claims Spears saw the events in her life &quot;through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one&quot;, but that she &quot;needed help&quot; and was &quot;in no state to responsibly manage her own affairs&quot;.</p>
<p>Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could &quot;never fully get behind it&quot;.</p>
<p>The pair got together in the summer of 2004, as Spears&#x27;s initial commercial peak started to wane.</p>
<p>They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.</p>
<p>Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.</p>
<p>The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.</p>
<p>In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.</p>
