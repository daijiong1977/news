                    <div class="article-content">For decades, doctors have depended on indicators such as body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio to gauge a person's risk for chronic disease. But researchers are now turning their attention to a different, often-overlooked measurement: neck circumference.

While a thick neck may suggest physical power, like that of athletes in contact sports, research indicates it could also be a marker of hidden health risks.

BMI calculates body fat by comparing weight to height, but it doesn't always paint an accurate picture. A muscular athlete may register a high BMI without carrying excess fat. This is where measuring neck size can offer additional clues about what's happening inside the body.

Studies have found that individuals with larger necks relative to their body size are more likely to develop serious health issues. The reason lies in fat distribution -- particularly in the upper body.

Fat stored around the upper torso releases fatty acids into the bloodstream, which can interfere with how the body regulates cholesterol, blood sugar, and heart rhythm. In effect, neck circumference acts as a visible indicator of visceral fat, the harmful kind that accumulates around internal organs.

The Link to Heart Disease and Other Conditions

Evidence connecting neck size to health outcomes is compelling. People with thicker necks show higher rates of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.

Atrial fibrillation is of particular concern because it causes irregular heartbeats and erratic blood flow, raising the risk of blood clots and stroke. Over time, this irregular rhythm can strain the heart and lead to failure.

Neck circumference is also tied to coronary heart disease, where narrowed arteries reduce the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart.

The risks don't stop at cardiovascular problems. Larger neck size is associated with a greater likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, both of which can lead to long-term complications such as nerve damage, vision loss, and limb amputation.

Sleep disorders are another major concern. A thicker neck is a known risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. This not only leads to severe daytime fatigue but also places additional stress on the heart and blood vessels. People with sleep apnea are also more prone to accidents caused by exhaustion.

When Neck Size Becomes a Warning

So, how big is too big? Research suggests that men with a neck circumference of 17 inches (43 cm) or more, and women with 14 inches (35.5 cm) or more, face elevated health risks.

Perhaps most surprising, these dangers are not limited to people who are overweight. Even individuals with a normal BMI may be at risk if their neck measurements exceed these thresholds. For every additional centimeter beyond that range, the likelihood of hospitalization and early death increases.

If your neck measurement falls above these levels, there's no reason for alarm, but it's worth noting. Neck size represents only one piece of your overall health profile, yet it can reveal important information that other metrics might overlook.</div>

                    <div class="article-content">A tight work deadline, a clogged toilet, or a disagreement with a loved one can make an ordinary day feel overwhelming. When several of these small frustrations build up, stress can quickly escalate. But according to new research that includes scientists from Penn State, simply feeling more in control might help make those everyday challenges easier to handle.

The study found that on days when people felt they had greater control over their stressors, they were 62% more likely to take action -- such as calling a plumber or addressing a difficult conversation -- to solve the problem. This effect became even stronger with age. The results suggest that a person's sense of control can serve as an important psychological resource that can be strengthened over time to help manage stress and improve health outcomes.

The findings were published in the journal Communications Psychology.

"This research shows that even small boosts in how much control people feel they have over everyday hassles make it more likely that those hassles actually get resolved," said David Almeida, professor of human development and family studies at Penn State and senior author on the paper. "Learning to find and act on these pockets of control in daily life may not only reduce stress but also support long-term health and well-being."

Previous work led by Almeida has shown that stress responses fluctuate over time and that even minor daily inconveniences can affect health when they accumulate. Actively resolving stressors -- such as clearing up an argument -- is a key part of processing stress and allows emotions to settle more quickly.

Measuring How Control Affects Stress

In this new study, the researchers wanted to know whether a sense of personal control -- how much people feel they can influence their daily challenges -- affects whether a stressor gets resolved. For instance, does believing you can fix a billing mistake make you more likely to call the company? The team also examined what influences that sense of control, including the type of stress, how often stressors occur, and socioeconomic conditions.

"If perceived stressor control promotes stress resolution, can we leverage that as a modifiable resource to influence stressor resolution and therefore our emotional health and well-being?" asked lead author Dakota Witzel, who was a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for Healthy Aging at Penn State during the time of the research and is now an assistant professor at South Dakota State University.

Tracking Daily Stress Over a Decade

The researchers analyzed data from more than 1,700 adults who took part in the National Study of Daily Experiences, part of the long-running Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS), a national study on health and well-being. For eight consecutive days, participants reported any daily stressors they experienced within the previous 24 hours and whether each stressor was resolved by the end of the day. Common sources of stress included interpersonal tensions (arguments or avoided arguments), home or work overload, and "network stress" -- problems affecting friends or family that still caused distress for the participant.

Participants also rated how much control they felt over each stressor on a four-point scale (none, a little, some, or a lot of control). The same survey was repeated with these participants 10 years later to see whether the connection between perceived control and stress resolution changed with time.

Control Levels Fluctuate From Day to Day

Results showed that people's sense of control can shift greatly from one day to the next. In other words, feeling in control is not a fixed personal trait -- it's a daily perception that varies depending on circumstances.

Across all ages, on days when people felt more in control than usual -- for instance, feeling "some" control instead of "a little" -- they were significantly more likely to resolve the stressor. This pattern held true regardless of the stressor's type or intensity.

Interestingly, the connection grew stronger with age. Early in the study, participants who felt a higher-than-usual level of control were 61% more likely to resolve their stressors that day. A decade later, the same boost in perceived control raised that likelihood to 65%.</div>

                    <div class="article-content">Scientists have developed a promising cancer therapy that uses LED light and ultra-thin flakes of tin to eliminate cancer cells while protecting healthy tissue. Unlike traditional chemotherapy and other invasive treatments, this new method avoids the painful side effects patients often endure.

The breakthrough comes from a partnership between The University of Texas at Austin and the University of Porto in Portugal, made possible through the UT Austin Portugal Program. The collaboration aims to make light-based cancer therapies more accessible and affordable. Current versions of these treatments rely on expensive materials, specialized lab setups, and powerful lasers that can sometimes damage surrounding tissue. By switching to LEDs and introducing tin-based "SnOx nanoflakes" ("Sn" is the chemical symbol for tin), the researchers have created a safer and potentially low-cost alternative.

LED Light and Nanoflakes Team Up Against Cancer

"Our goal was to create a treatment that is not only effective but also safe and accessible," said Jean Anne Incorvia, a professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering's Chandra Family Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and one of the leaders on the project. "With the combination of LED light and SnOx nanoflakes, we've developed a method to precisely target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells untouched."

In a recent study published in ACS Nano, the approach proved highly effective against both colorectal and skin cancer cells. After only 30 minutes of exposure, the LED-driven treatment destroyed up to 92% of skin cancer cells and 50% of colorectal cancer cells, while leaving healthy human skin cells unharmed. The results highlight the therapy's precision and safety.

A Safer Alternative to Conventional Cancer Treatments

Cancer remains the second-leading cause of death worldwide, and many existing treatments come with severe side effects. Scientists across the globe are exploring new methods to make therapies safer and more targeted. One of the most promising is near-infrared photothermal therapy, which uses light to heat and destroy cancer cells without the need for surgery or toxic drugs. This principle forms the foundation of the UT Austin-Portugal team's research.

Having shown strong early results, the researchers are now focused on understanding how light and heat interact in the process and on testing other materials that might enhance the treatment. They also plan to design practical medical devices that can deliver the therapy directly to patients.

Bringing Light-Based Cancer Care to Patients

"Our ultimate goal is to make this technology available to patients everywhere, especially places where access to specialized equipment is limited, with fewer side effects and lower cost," said Artur Pinto, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto and lead researcher of the project in Portugal. "For skin cancers in particular, we envision that one day, treatment could move from the hospital to the patient's home. A portable device could be placed on the skin after surgery to irradiate and destroy any remaining cancer cells, reducing the risk of recurrence."

Incorvia and Pinto first teamed up through the UT Austin Portugal Program in 2021. Since then, they have exchanged visits between Texas and Portugal and combined their expertise to explore how two-dimensional materials can be used to advance cancer therapies.

Expanding the Research Frontier

Building on their success, the team recently received additional funding through the UT Austin Portugal Program to create an implant for breast cancer patients using the same LED and nanoflake technology. Their continued collaboration could pave the way for more personalized, affordable, and pain-free cancer treatments in the near future.

Fernandes of the University of TrÃ¡s-os-Montes and Alto Douro, who developed the LED systems.

The UT Austin Portugal Program is a long-standing science and technology partnership between UT and the Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology (FCT). Portugal has similar partnerships with two other U.S. universities -- the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon University -- and its 17-year collaboration with UT was recently renewed for another five years.</div>

                    <div class="article-content">By the time most people begin seeking help for multiple sclerosis (MS), the disease has already been quietly injuring the brain for years. Until recently, scientists were uncertain which cells were affected first or when the damage actually started.

Tracking the Disease's Earliest Attacks

Researchers at UC San Francisco have now provided the most detailed timeline yet by analyzing thousands of proteins circulating in the blood. Their findings show that the immune system begins attacking the brain's protective myelin sheath -- the fatty covering that insulates nerve fibers -- much earlier than scientists once believed.

The team measured fragments of myelin and other molecules left behind by immune attacks, along with the chemical signals that drive the immune system's response. This work allowed them to outline, for the first time, the chain of biological events that ultimately leads to the onset of MS.

The discovery opens the door to earlier diagnosis and, in the future, may make prevention possible.

The Body's Early Warning Signs

The research showed that MS first targets the myelin sheath. About a year later, evidence of damage to the underlying nerve fibers themselves begins to appear.

Among the immune-related proteins that rose during this initial stage, one stood out: IL-3. This molecule plays a central role in the early disease phase, when the central nervous system is already taking significant damage even though patients do not yet experience symptoms. IL-3 helps recruit immune cells into the brain and spinal cord, where they begin attacking nerve tissue.

"We think our work opens numerous opportunities for diagnosing, monitoring, and possibility treating MS," said Ahmed Abdelhak, MD, assistant professor of Neurology at UCSF, and the first and co-lead author of the paper, which was published in Nature Medicine on Oct. 20. "It could be a gamechanger for how we understand and manage this disease."

Following Blood Clues Years Before Diagnosis

The researchers analyzed more than 5,000 different proteins in blood samples from 134 individuals who eventually developed MS. These samples came from the U.S. Department of Defense Serum Repository, which stores blood from military applicants. Because the repository holds samples for decades, scientists were able to examine blood drawn years before these individuals were diagnosed.

Seven years prior to diagnosis, the researchers detected a spike in a protein known as MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein), which signals damage to the myelin insulation around nerve fibers. Roughly a year later, they observed a rise in neurofilament light chain, a marker of injury to the nerve fibers themselves.

During this same window, IL-3 and several related immune proteins appeared in the bloodstream, indicating that an immune assault was already underway.

Building the Foundation for a Predictive Blood Test

In total, the team identified about 50 proteins that could serve as early indicators of MS. They have since filed a patent application for a diagnostic blood test based on the 21 most reliable markers.</div>

                    <div class="article-content">The rapid loss of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is often seen as an environmental catastrophe. Yet researchers have found that the same melting process could help sustain life in unexpected ways. As the ice retreats, it creates conditions that encourage the growth of algae, the foundation of the Arctic's marine food web.

Algae form the base of most ocean ecosystems, but they depend on nitrogen to grow -- and nitrogen is scarce in Arctic waters. Now, an international team led by the University of Copenhagen has discovered that more nitrogen may become available than scientists once believed. This shift could reshape the future of marine life in the region and influence how much carbon the ocean can absorb.

A Hidden Source of Nitrogen Beneath the Ice

The study is the first to confirm that nitrogen fixation -- a process in which certain bacteria transform nitrogen gas (N2) dissolved in seawater into ammonium -- occurs beneath Arctic sea ice, even in its most remote and central areas. Ammonium not only helps these bacteria thrive but also nourishes algae and, by extension, the creatures that depend on them.

"Until now, it was believed that nitrogen fixation could not take place under the sea ice because it was assumed that the living conditions for the organisms that perform nitrogen fixation were too poor. We were wrong," says Lisa W. von Friesen, lead author of the study and former PhD student at the Department of Biology.

Unlike most other oceans where cyanobacteria dominate nitrogen fixation, the Arctic Ocean relies on an entirely different group of bacteria known as non-cyanobacteria. The researchers found the highest nitrogen fixation rates along the ice edge -- where melting is most intense. While these bacteria can operate beneath the ice, they flourish along the melting boundary. As climate change accelerates ice retreat, this expanding melt zone could allow more nitrogen to enter the ecosystem.

"In other words, the amount of available nitrogen in the Arctic Ocean has likely been underestimated, both today and for future projections. This could mean that the potential for algae production has also been underestimated as climate change continues to reduce the sea ice cover," says von Friesen.

"Because algae are the primary food source for small animals such as planktonic crustaceans, which in turn are eaten by small fish, more algae can end up affecting the entire food chain," she adds.

Could This Help the Planet Absorb More CO2?

This new nitrogen source could also influence how much carbon dioxide the Arctic Ocean takes in. More algae mean more photosynthesis, which enables the ocean to capture greater amounts of CO2.

"For the climate and the environment, this is likely good news. If algae production increases, the Arctic Ocean will absorb more CO2 because more CO2 will be bound in algae biomass. But biological systems are very complex, so it is hard to make firm predictions, because other mechanisms may pull in the opposite direction," explains Lasse Riemann, professor at the Department of Biology and senior author of the study.

The researchers emphasize that nitrogen fixation should now be considered in models predicting the Arctic's future. "We do not yet know whether the net effect will be beneficial for the climate. But it is clear that we should include an important process such as nitrogen fixation in the equation when we try to predict what will happen to the Arctic Ocean in the coming decades as sea ice declines," adds Riemann.

In the Arctic, non-cyanobacteria perform nitrogen fixation. These microorganisms consume dissolved organic matter -- often released by algae -- and in turn, produce fixed nitrogen that promotes further algal growth. This exchange creates a small but vital nutrient loop beneath the ice.

Algae play a double role in the ecosystem: they are both the starting point of the marine food chain and natural absorbers of CO2. As they grow, they pull carbon dioxide from the air, which can later sink to the ocean floor as part of their biomass.

The study, published in Communications Earth & Environment, involved scientists from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark), Linnaeus University (Sweden), Alfred Wegener Institute (Germany), Aix Marseille University (France), National Oceanography Centre (United Kingdom), Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (Germany), Stockholm University (Sweden), and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (Sweden).</div>
