<p>British designer Grace Wales Bonner has been named as the new creative director of menswear for French fashion house Hermès.</p>
<p>The appointment means Wales Bonner, a 35-year-old Londoner, is now the first black woman to lead design at a major fashion house, according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>In a statement, Wales Bonner said she was &quot;deeply honoured to be entrusted with the role&quot;.</p>
<p>She replaces Véronique Nichanian, who has been the company&#x27;s artistic director of menswear division for 37 years.</p>
<p>Her final collection for the brand will be shown in Paris in January, while Wales Bonner&#x27;s first collection will launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In her statement, Wales Bonner said: &quot;It is a dream realised to embark on this new chapter, following in a lineage of inspired craftspeople and designers.&quot;</p>
<p>She also thanked the company&#x27;s bosses &quot;for the opportunity to bring my vision to this magical house&quot;.</p>
<p>Reporting the news on Tuesday, Vogue said: &quot;While industry insiders were betting on a promotion from within, Hermès went for a renowned talent.&quot;</p>
<p>Wales Bonner, who was born in London to an English mother and Jamaican father, founded her own label in 2014, not long after graduating from London&#x27;s Central Saint Martins College of Art.</p>
<p>According to Vogue, Wales Bonner will continue her namesake brand alongside her new Hermès role.</p>
<p>She dressed F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, musician FKA Twigs, and actor Jeff Goldblum for this year&#x27;s Met Gala and has made T-shirts with musician Solange Knowles, younger sister of Beyoncé.</p>
<p>Wales Bonner has also curated an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and hosted musical performances at London&#x27;s Serpentine Galleries.</p>
<p>She has had a long-standing collaboration with Adidas and was made a MBE in 2022 for services to fashion.</p>
<p>Pierre-Alexis Dumas, general artistic director of Hermès, said: &quot;I am really pleased to welcome Grace to the Hermès artistic director family.</p>
<p>&quot;Her take on contemporary fashion, craft and culture will contribute to shaping Hermès men&#x27;s style, melding the house&#x27;s heritage with a confident look on the now.</p>

<h4>From the Brits to the brink, Bad Boy Chiller Crew are back</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20z0e4v3kzo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_c60d28ba745f.webp'></p>
<p>Bad Boy Chiller Crew forgive anyone who forgot about them.</p>
<p>The trio&#x27;s brand of Bradford bassline earned them a UK top 10 single with BMW in 2022.</p>
<p>And their first album, Disrespectful, would have made number one if Ed Sheeran&#x27;s = (Equals) hadn&#x27;t got in its way.</p>
<p>By 2023 Gareth &quot;GK&quot; Kelly, Kane Welsh and Sam &quot;Clive&quot; Robinson were riding high, nominated for group of the year at the Brits alongside The 1975 and Arctic Monkeys.</p>
<p>Just as they were building momentum, they tell BBC Newsbeat, they were forced to hit pause when a legal dispute erupted with record label House Anxiety.</p>
<p>Unable to release new tracks, they swapped making music for combing through contracts. Kane says it was like &quot;jogging on the spot&quot;.</p>
<p>In July, a judge confirmed that a deal between the band and the record label had expired.</p>
<p>The group admit they&#x27;d considered going their separate ways during their hiatus.</p>
<p>&quot;I was ready to give it up,&quot; GK tells Newsbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn&#x27;t earn a living. What we had left got thrown into solicitor and court fees.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the worst time of our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Kane says it&#x27;s a relief to share music they&#x27;ve had ready and waiting on hard drives for months.</p>
<p>&quot;We were putting all this work and effort in, eight hours a day, making music that we couldn&#x27;t even release,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>GK adds: &quot;But what we&#x27;re trying to do is bring the old sound back.&quot;</p>
<p>The band are drip-feeding fans remixes of songs from their breakthrough mixtape, Full Wack No Breaks.</p>

<h4>Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4nr1415wo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_96d9a7c811a1.webp'></p>
<p>The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair&#x27;s tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.</p>
<p>Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears&#x27;s allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.</p>
<p>Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.</p>
<p>Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book&#x27;s release by publisher Listenin.</p>
<p>He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.</p>
<p>When they were teenagers, the couple&#x27;s sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. &quot;They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - &#x27;Oh, you&#x27;re awake?&#x27; - with a knife in her hand,&quot; he writes. &quot;Then she&#x27;d turn around and pad off without explanation.&quot;</p>
<p>Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: &quot;The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it&#x27;s racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we&#x27;re getting close to the 11th hour.&quot;</p>
<p>He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears&#x27;s life were controlled by others for years, and described it as a &quot;lifeline&quot; in its early days.</p>
<p>He claims Spears saw the events in her life &quot;through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one&quot;, but that she &quot;needed help&quot; and was &quot;in no state to responsibly manage her own affairs&quot;.</p>
<p>Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could &quot;never fully get behind it&quot;.</p>
<p>The pair got together in the summer of 2004, as Spears&#x27;s initial commercial peak started to wane.</p>
<p>They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.</p>
<p>Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.</p>
<p>The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.</p>
<p>In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.</p>

<h4>Colman Domingo cast as cowardly Lion in upcoming Wicked sequel</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5e3p23dzvo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_2a8d95575cf3.webp'></p>
<p>American actor and playwright Colman Domingo has been cast as the Cowardly Lion in the upcoming Wicked: For Good film, putting to rest a weekend of internet speculation on who would play the role.</p>
<p>Jon M Chu, the director for the highly-anticipated sequel film adaptation for the hit Broadway musical, teased the news on Thursday by saying a major Hollywood star will voice the part.</p>
<p>Domingo joins an already star-studded cast that includes Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba.</p>
<p>The film also stars Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum.</p>
<p>Chu told entertainment news outlet Deadline that he approached Domingo for the role of the Cowardly Lion on Instagram.</p>
<p>&quot;I was like, &#x27;It&#x27;s not a ton of lines, but maybe you have a little time. I know you&#x27;re busy. I&#x27;ll come to you,&#x27;&quot; Chu said, according to Deadline. Domingo responded &quot;Why the f--- not. Let&#x27;s go,&quot; he recalled.</p>
<p>The Broadway superstar has been nominated twice for an Academy Award, and has won a Primetime Emmy Award. He was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2024 by Time Magazine.</p>
<p>Buzz has been growing around the sequel Wicked: For Good since the first film was released in November 2024. The first full-length trailer for the sequel was unveiled in June.</p>
<p>Elphaba is now an enemy of the state of Oz, while Glinda has become a public figure controlled by the Wizard, who is played by Goldblum.</p>
<p>The film&#x27;s trailer also teases the arrival of Dorothy - seen walking down the yellow brick road with her friends - suggesting the character might have a bigger role in the films than in the musical. It&#x27;s still unclear who might be cast to play the character.</p>
<p>The films have been adapted from the hugely successful Broadway and West End musical, which itself was based on Gregory Maguire&#x27;s 1995 novel.</p>
<p>The two movies were shot simultaneously at Sky Studios Elstree in the United Kingdon between December 2022 and January 2024, with production interrupted mid-way through by the Hollywood actors&#x27; strike.</p>
<p>Wicked was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations - winning two for best costume and production design.</p>
<p>The sequel movie is set to be released almost a year-to-the-date of its predecessor on 21 November.</p>
<p>Sabrina Carpenter was also among the award winners and performers on the night in New York.</p>

<h4>US chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky dies aged 29</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15pz8vpjp9o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_94dca8c07be3.webp'></p>
<p>US chess grandmaster and popular YouTube chess commentator Daniel Naroditsky has died aged 29.</p>
<p>The chess player&#x27;s family announced his &quot;unexpected&quot; death in a statement released by his club, the Charlotte Chess Center, on Monday. No cause of death was given.</p>
<p>The statement described him as a &quot;cherished member of the chess community, admired and respected by fans and players around the world&quot;.</p>
<p>Naroditsky was famous for his chess YouTube channel, which featured video tutorials and livestreams against competitors, and inspired hundreds of thousands of people across the world to play the game.</p>
<p>Naroditsky&#x27;s channel had nearly 500,000 subscribers, while his Twitch stream drummed up 340,000 followers.</p>
<p>Fans praised his insight and passion, casually referring to him as &quot;Danya&quot;.</p>
<p>He played a &quot;pivotal role in popularising chess content online&quot;, the International Chess Federation said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a massive loss for the world of chess,&quot; chess world number two, Hikaru Nakamura, said in a social media post.</p>
<p>Nakamura - a close friend of Naroditsky - told the BBC &quot;he inspired hundreds of thousands of people to play chess - a lot of people loved his videos&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;When it came to making chess content to help beginners, his was the best,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have played more than a thousand games of chess with Daniel,&quot; Nakamura added. &quot;Chess is a very cut-throat world and emotions run high, but Daniel was always calm.&quot;</p>
<p>The online content creation &quot;wasn&#x27;t about money for him&quot;, Nakamura said. &quot;He had a true passion for the game.&quot;</p>
<p>Naroditsky first took an interest in chess at the age of six, when his older brother Alan asked him to help entertain a group of children at a birthday party.</p>
<p>His father Vladimir and multiple coaches soon noticed his talents.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as I was concerned, I was just playing games with my brother,&quot; Naroditsky told the New York Times in a 2022 interview.</p>

<h4>Stefan Dennis withdraws from Strictly Come Dancing due to injury</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl2k475x02o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_f92b16e671a3.webp'></p>
<p>Actor and Neighbours star Stefan Dennis has withdrawn from Strictly Come Dancing due to injury.</p>
<p>&quot;I was told that on Saturday I had torn my calf so significantly that I am now forced to withdraw from the show,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Australian was a contestant in the BBC dance show, partnered with professional Dianne Buswell.</p>
<p>&quot;I owe both the Strictly Family and Dianne a massive debt of gratitude for giving me the opportunity to fulfil my dream of being able to dance with my wife. (When my leg is better),&quot; the 66-year-old added.</p>
<p>The actor had only just returned to the show, after missing his week three performance due to an illness.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a little bit of a turn, a little bit of an episode with vertigo,&quot; he said during an appearance on companion programme Strictly: It Takes Two.</p>
<p>&quot;But it was all OK, I made myself right again with the help of some good people at the hospital,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dennis&#x27;s return, in week four of the show on Saturday, saw him and Buswell secure their highest score of the series - performing a Charleston to the song Dance Monkey by Australian musician Tones and I.</p>
<p>Strictly judge Shirley Ballas said Dennis had come &quot;back with a bang&quot;, and that he had pushed his limits with a difficult routine.</p>
<p>The pair are scheduled to be interviewed on Strictly: It Takes Two on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dennis is best known for playing Paul Robinson in Neighbours, the longest-running character in Australian television history.</p>
<p>Following his first appearance in 1985, he went on to feature in 6,000 episodes across four decades.</p>
<p>His partner Buswell made history this Strictly series - becoming the first professional dancer to compete on the show while pregnant.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m still doing everything I did before,&quot; she said ahead of the beginning of the series.</p>
<p>Speaking on her podcast Winning Isn&#x27;t Everything, she added: &quot;Obviously with lifts there&#x27;s going to be a bit more caution. But my doctor has said everything is normal.&quot;</p>

<h4>Presenter&#x27;s Toto adventure book becomes stage play</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04gzp3nng3o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_b28a3ee3276d.webp'></p>
<p>TV and radio presenter Dermot O&#x27;Leary says he is &quot;over the moon&quot; that the first in his successful six-part children&#x27;s book series is to become a stage musical.</p>
<p>O&#x27;Leary based his Toto the Ninja Cat stories on his real pet, a blind moggy he adopted in Italy, which he said showed &quot;incredible reactions&quot;.</p>
<p>The first in the series, Toto The Ninja Cat And The Great Snake Escape, has been adapted for the stage and will tour England next year, starting in the star&#x27;s home city of Colchester.</p>
<p>&quot;Toto is currently fast asleep, blissfully unaware of all the attention, but speaking on her behalf, she&#x27;ll be thrilled to bits that her adventures are about to come to life,&quot; the 52-year-old told BBC Breakfast.</p>
<p>The story follows Toto, a cat that is completely blind but uses ninja skills which aid her in her adventures with her brother Silver.</p>
<p>&quot;I turned her into a member of the Ancient Order of Ninja Cats,&quot; O&#x27;Leary added, &quot;and she works for Larry, the Downing Street cat.</p>
<p>&quot;I grew up going to the Mercury Theatre, to see panto and plays. I can&#x27;t wait to see what they&#x27;ve done with it.&quot;</p>
<p>The production, adapted from page to stage by Samantha Lane, artistic director of Little Angel Theatre, and musician Barb Jungr, will be filled with original music and puppetry.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m over the moon to see my book brought to life through puppetry,&quot; O&#x27;Leary added.</p>
<p>Illustrator Nick East said: &quot;Working with Dermot on the Toto The Ninja Cat series has been an utter delight, and I&#x27;m thrilled that the amazing Little Angel team are now giving our fearless feline a whole new adventure in puppet form.&quot;</p>
<p>The stage show will also play London&#x27;s Little Angel Theatre, as well as Southampton, Bristol, Birmingham, Weymouth and Guildford.</p>
<p>O&#x27;Leary, who presents on ITV&#x27;s This Morning and BBC Radio 2, is the author of a number of children&#x27;s books, including Spy Fox And Agent Feathers and Wings Of Glory.</p>

<h4>Prince Andrew should share what he saw of Epstein abuse, co-author tells BBC</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c201k3wd65yo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_4dde5d1334b3.webp'></p>
<p>Ahead of the release, co-author Amy Wallace told BBC Newsnight there was a period when Prince Andrew &quot;indicated he was willing to help investigators in the US&quot; but he was &quot;never available, for some reason&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s something he could still do,&quot; Ms Wallace - who spent four years writing the book with Ms Giuffre - added.</p>
<p>Ms Wallace said: &quot;He could say, as he has repeatedly, &#x27;I still deny that I was involved... however, I was in these houses and I was on that island and I was on the jet and I saw things, and I know how much these women have suffered and I would like to share what I saw&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>Senior politicians - including government minister Peter Kyle - also said on Tuesday that Prince Andrew should speak to US authorities about Epstein&#x27;s crimes.</p>
<p>In an interview with BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Today programme, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said Andrew should give evidence to US authorities &quot;about what he knew and what his involvement was&quot; in the Epstein scandal.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre - who took her own life earlier this year - says in her book that she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, which he denies.</p>
<p>She says the third occasion was on Epstein&#x27;s island as part of what Ms Giuffre called &quot;an orgy&quot; with Epstein and approximately eight other young women.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, announced on Friday that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles including the Duke of York, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
<p>He is also giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.</p>
<p>But there are still calls for them to be formally removed.</p>
<p>Ms Wallace said: &quot;I can speak for Virginia; I know that she would view it as a victory that he was forced, by whatever means, to voluntarily give them up.&quot;</p>
<p>She called it a &quot;symbolic gesture&quot; which has made &quot;modern history in terms of the royal era&quot;, describing it as &quot;a step in the right direction&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Virginia wanted all the men who she had been trafficked to, against her will, to be held to account, and this is just one of the men.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though he [Andrew] continues to deny it, his life is being eroded because of his past behaviour, as it should be,&quot; Ms Wallace said.</p>
<p>Ms Wallace said the private jets used by Epstein &quot;had been remodelled in order to afford many bedrooms - they were designed as flying trafficking agents, they were there to use girls in&quot;.</p>

<h4>Stolen treasures, a crown dropped as thieves fled - and serious questions for Louvre security</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0e24rrjz1o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_705beaeda26d.webp'></p>
<p>It is the most spectacular robbery at the Louvre museum since the Mona Lisa disappeared in 1911.</p>
<p>And it poses serious questions about levels of security covering French artworks, at a time when they are increasingly being targeted by criminal gangs.</p>
<p>According to France&#x27;s new interior minister Laurent Nuñez, the gang that broke into the Apollo Gallery on Sunday morning was clearly professional.</p>
<p>They knew what they wanted, had evidently &quot;cased the joint&quot; in advance, had a brazenly simple but effective modus operandi, and needed no more than seven minutes to take their booty and get away.</p>
<p>In a truck equipped with an elevating platform of the type used by removal companies, they parked on the street outside, raised themselves up to the first floor, then used a disc-cutter to enter through a window.</p>
<p>Inside the richly decorated gallery they made for two display-cases which contain what remains of the French crown jewels.</p>
<p>Most of France&#x27;s royal regalia was lost or sold after the 1789 Revolution, but some items were saved or bought back. Most of what was in the cases, though, dates from the 19th Century and the two imperial families of Napoleon and his nephew Napoleon III.</p>
<p>According to the authorities, eight items were taken including diadems, necklaces, ear-rings and brooches.</p>
<p>They had belonged to Napoleon&#x27;s wife the empress Marie-Louise; to his sister-in-law Queen Hortense of Holland; to Queen Marie-Amelie, wife of France&#x27;s last King Louis-Philippe, who ruled from 1830 to 1848; and to the empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, who ruled from 1852 to 1870.</p>
<p>A crown of the empress Eugénie was also taken, but was recovered damaged near the museum after the thieves seemingly dropped it.</p>
<p>In a statement the culture ministry said that the alarms had sounded correctly. Five museum staff who were in the gallery or nearby followed protocol by contacting security forces and protecting visitors.</p>
<p>It said the gang had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member.</p>
<p>The heist took place in a gallery just a short walk from some of the world&#x27;s most famous paintings - such as the Mona Lisa.</p>
<p>But the criminal groups that order heists like this do not target world-famous paintings that cannot ever be displayed or sold. They prefer items that can be converted into cash - and jewels top the list.</p>
<p>However huge their historical and cultural value, crowns and diadems can easily be broken apart and sold in bits. Even large and famous diamonds can be cut. The final sales price might not be what the original artefact was worth, but it will still be considerable.</p>

<h4>Singer Matt Willis to front series on addiction recovery</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93dl998kvno?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_e6f9d246d6f4.webp'></p>
<p>Musician Matt Willis will front a new series that explores addiction and recovery in south Wales.</p>
<p>The three-part documentary follows the Busted co-founder as he develops a new pilot scheme to help people in recovery rebuild their lives through work and help from the local community.</p>
<p>Willis, who has spoken openly about his own battles with addiction, said he wants to challenge stigma and spark fresh conversation about how recovery is supported in the UK.</p>
<p>&quot;I know what it&#x27;s like going to rehab. I know what it&#x27;s like to relapse and I know what its like to be given a second chance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Having battled his own addiction to drugs and alcohol for more than a decade, Willis said he wanted to use his experience to make a difference.</p>
<p>&quot;I know what it&#x27;s like to say I am a drug addict, and the stigma that comes with that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The series will see Willis travel across south Wales, where some communities face the highest rates of drug and alcohol-related deaths in the country.</p>
<p>He will meet experts, charities and people in recovery, exploring how meaningful employment and community support can help rebuild lives.</p>
<p>Catherine Catton, head of commissioning for BBC Factual Entertainment and Events, said Willis&#x27; personal connection to the subject brought depth to the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;When you meet Matt, you see how deeply committed he is to helping others through recovery,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a real privilege to follow Matt as he brings this unique project to life, aiming to create something with genuine legacy.&quot;</p>

<p>Virginia Giuffre says she feared she might &quot;die a sex slave&quot; at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and his circle, her posthumous memoir reveals.</p>
<p>In the memoir, Ms Giuffre also says she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, including once with Epstein and approximately eight other young women.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has always denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>At the centre of the abuse was Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre says that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared them both.</p>
<p>Much of the book makes for extremely harrowing reading, as Ms Giuffre details the sadistic abuse that Epstein put her through.</p>
<p>She says Epstein subjected her to sadomasochistic sex which caused her &quot;so much pain that I prayed I would black out&quot;.</p>
<p>A Buckingham Palace source told BBC News they accept there could be &quot;more days of pain ahead&quot; as a result of the publication of the book, which puts Prince Andrew under further scrutiny.</p>
<p>The King&#x27;s engagements this week include a visit to the Vatican, where he will pray alongside the Pope.</p>
<p>On Friday, Prince Andrew announced that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles including the Duke of York, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
<p>He is also giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.</p>
<p>In his statement, he said: &quot;I vigorously deny the accusations against me.&quot;</p>
<p>They include Rachael Maskell, Independent MP for York Central, and Stephen Flynn, SNP leader at Westminster.</p>
<p>Maskell told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Today programme that it was &quot;incredibly strange that you can give a title, but you can&#x27;t remove a title&quot;. She argued a simple, single clause would give a monarch the powers to do this for any titles, including peerages.</p>
<p>Flynn said there was &quot;no justification&quot; for the UK government not to take action to remove Andrew&#x27;s titles.</p>

<h4>These confederate statues caused US protests. Knocked down, they&#x27;re the centre of a new art show</h4>

<p>A massive monument of General Robert E Lee that once sparked riots in the Virginia city of Charlottesville is now a pile of melted-down bronze, artfully displayed in a Los Angeles museum.</p>
<p>Next to the sculpture are barrels of toxic &quot;slag&quot; leftover from the melting process.</p>
<p>Around the corner, there is a massive, graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson - the two most famous Confederate generals in the US Civil War, which the Confederacy lost in 1865 and ultimately led to the end of slavery in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;They fought for slavery,&quot; says curator Hamza Walker, who has been working for eight years to acquire and borrow the massive monuments amid lawsuits and the logistical challenges of moving tens of thousands of pounds of bronze and granite to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of lionising those figures. What did they believe? They believed in white supremacy. Period.&quot;</p>
<p>Coming at a time when President Donald Trump is ordering statues and paintings of Confederate generals to be reinstalled, the warring narratives of American history are at the heart of &quot;Monuments,&quot; which opens 23 October at The Brick and at the Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art.</p>
<p>The 10 decommissioned Confederate monuments are displayed alongside pieces of contemporary art. The massive, graffitied statue of Lee and Jackson, for example, stands next to a giant replica sculpture of the &quot;General Lee&quot; car from the iconic TV show, The Dukes of Hazzard.</p>
<p>President Trump has often spoken of General Lee&#x27;s bravery and he and others have criticised the removal and toppling of Confederate monuments, saying it&#x27;s revisionist history.</p>
<p>White nationalists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, triggering deadly clashes, to keep the statue from being removed. In the aftermath, similar statues sparked clashes in cities across the US.</p>
<p>&quot;Under this historical revision, our Nation&#x27;s unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed,&quot; President Trump wrote in a March executive order calling for paintings and monuments to be reinstalled.</p>
<p>But Mr Walker says putting Lee and Jackson on pedestals - even though they lost the war - is racist and promotes the Lost Cause ideology that argues the Civil War was a noble cause for states&#x27; rights and not about slavery.</p>
<p>&quot;States rights to do what? The reason for the Civil War was slavery,&quot; he said, adding that it perpetuates the idea that the South was a &quot;noble victim&quot;, and that slavery wasn&#x27;t so terrible.</p>
<p>&quot;If you could distance them from slavery, right, then you could portray them as heroes, even though they lost the war and were on the wrong side of history, fighting for something that was morally repugnant,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the show is &quot;Unmanned Drone&quot; - a completely reconstructed sculpture of Stonewall Jackson by artist Kara Walker, who transformed the horse and its rider heading into battle into a headless, zombie-like creature.</p>
<p>&quot;The southern vernacular would be a &#x27;haint&#x27;, which would be a ghostly form,&quot; Kara Walker, who is not related to Hamza Walker, told the BBC when asked how she describes the work. &quot;It&#x27;s an attempt to rethink the legacies of Stonewall Jackson as a mythology, as mythological holder for white supremacy.&quot;</p>

<h4>From Hollywood to horticulture: Cate Blanchett on a mission to save seeds</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7ekl4yl8o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_069ea11cb487.webp'></p>
<p>She&#x27;s a Hollywood A-lister, with a mantelpiece groaning under the weight of awards. But Cate Blanchett has taken an unexpected diversion from her day job - to immerse herself in the world of the humble seed.</p>
<p>Her eyes light up as she enthuses about the banksia species from her native Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s quite a brutal looking seed pod that only releases its seed in extremely high temperatures,&quot; she tells us.</p>
<p>&quot;It does look like a cross between a mallet and a toilet brush. So they&#x27;re not always pretty, but yet what comes out of them is so spectacular.&quot;</p>
<p>We meet her at Kew&#x27;s Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) at Wakehurst botanic garden in Sussex. She lives locally and teamed up with the project as it celebrates its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>&quot;Really, I stumbled upon Wakehurst. I was just in awe of the landscape and I always feel regenerated by being in the natural world,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;And then I discovered the seed bank, and I literally had my mind blown by the work that goes on here... and I thought, anything I can do to be connected to it - I found it so inspiring.&quot;</p>
<p>The MSB is home to more than 2.5 billion seeds collected from 40,000 wild plant species around the world.</p>
<p>The seeds, which come in every shape, size and colour, are carefully processed, dried and then stored in freezers at a chilly -20C.</p>
<p>The conservation project was opened by The King - then the Prince of Wales - in 2000. He&#x27;s taken part in a special episode of a Kew podcast about the project called Unearthed: The Need For Seeds with Cate Blanchett.</p>
<p>In the recording he talks about his concerns that many plant species are being lost.</p>
<p>&quot;I know how absolutely critical it all is, and the destruction of rainforests, the extinction of endless species, which have very likely remarkable properties,&quot; he tells the podcast.</p>
<p>When the seed bank first opened, it was seen as a doomsday vault - a back-up store of seeds to safeguard wild plants from extinction.</p>
<p>But 25 years on, the collection is being used for a different purpose: to restore environments that are under threat.</p>
<p>&quot;We want those seeds to be back out in the landscape,&quot; explained Dr Elinor Breman from the MSB, who&#x27;s been showing Cate Blanchett the team&#x27;s work.</p>

<h4>Housing designed to combat loneliness wins top architecture award</h4>
<p><em><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwlz6k96no?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_f140a163c495.webp'></p>
<p>A modern answer to the traditional almshouse, designed to combat loneliness, has won a prestigious architecture award for Britain&#x27;s best new building.</p>
<p>Appleby Blue Almshouse, which provides affordable flats for over-65s in Southwark, south London, has won this year&#x27;s Royal Institute of British Architects&#x27; (Riba) Stirling Prize.</p>
<p>The complex, in Bermondsey, has 59 flats plus communal facilities, including a roof garden, courtyard and community kitchen.</p>
<p>The Stirling Prize judges said it &quot;sets an ambitious standard for social housing among older people&quot;.</p>
<p>Architects Witherford Watson Mann have crafted &quot;high-quality&quot; and &quot;thoughtful&quot; spaces to create environments that truly care for their residents&quot;, according to jury member Ingrid Schroder, director of the Architectural Association (AA) School of Architecture.</p>
<p>The building was praised for its &quot;generous&quot; homes, terracotta-paved hallways with benches and plants, and a water feature that gives the building the &quot;sense of a woodland oasis&quot;.</p>
<p>That all creates an &quot;aspirational living environment&quot; that stands &quot;in stark contrast to the institutional atmosphere often associated with older people&#x27;s housing&quot;, Riba said.</p>
<p>The Appleby Blue Almshouse was built on the site of an old care home by United St Saviour&#x27;s Charity, which subsidises the flats for people on low incomes.</p>
<p>Almshouses were traditionally built from the Middle Ages to provide charitable accommodation for people in need.</p>
<p>Appleby Blue beat a range of other nominated buildings and architecture projects to this year&#x27;s Stirling Prize, ranging from the restoration of the Big Ben tower in London to a new fashion college campus, a science laboratory and an &quot;inventive&quot; home extension.</p>
<p>The prize is given to the building judged to be &quot;the most significant of the year for the evolution of architecture and the built environment&quot;, and is judged on criteria including design vision, innovation and originality.</p>
<p>This is Witherford Watson Mann&#x27;s second time as winning architects, 12 years after they were selected for their design for a groundbreaking modern holiday home inside the ancient Astley Castle in Warwickshire.</p>
<p>The Elizabeth line - London&#x27;s east-west train line - won the prestigious award last year.</p>
<p>Other previous winners of the prize - first presented in 1996 - include Liverpool&#x27;s Everyman Theatre, Hastings Pier and the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Police say any UKIP members assembling in the area, which has a high Muslim population, face arrest.</p>
