<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump&#x27;s pick to lead an office charged with protecting federal whistleblowers appeared to be in jeopardy on Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he hoped the White House would withdraw the nomination.</p>
<p>The growing opposition to Paul Ingrassia comes after a Politico report of a text chat that showed him saying the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be &quot;tossed into the seventh circle of hell.&quot; Ingrassia also described himself in the chat as having &quot;a Nazi streak&quot; at times.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s not going to pass,&quot; Thune told reporters.</p>
<p>Two Republicans who serve on the committee with jurisdiction over the nomination for the Office of Special Counsel job, Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said they do not support Ingrassia&#x27;s confirmation.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m a no. It never should have got this far,&quot; Johnson said Tuesday. &quot;They ought to pull the nomination.&quot;</p>
<p>Republicans have been able to muscle through the vast majority of Trump&#x27;s nominees in roll call votes despite stiff Democratic opposition. But there have been sporadic instances when Republicans have pushed back, generally behind the scenes, showing there are limits to their support.</p>
<p>Most notably, Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump&#x27;s first choice for attorney general soon after being tabbed for the job. In May, Trump pulled his nomination of Ed Martin Jr. to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation&#x27;s capital, bowing to bipartisan concerns about the conservative activist&#x27;s modest legal experience and support for Jan. 6 rioters. And last month, the White House announced it would be withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni was supposed to succeed a BLS director who was fired following a disappointing jobs report.</p>
<p>According to texts viewed by Politico, Ingrassia told those in the chat that &quot;MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his &#x27;holiday&#x27; should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs.&quot; Politico also spoke to Ingrassia&#x27;s lawyer, who said the text messages might have been manipulated or were missing context. The lawyer did not confirm the texts were authentic.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Ingrassia&#x27;s texts, if authentic, were &quot;foul and disqualifying&quot; He said Trump should pull the nomination of Ingrassia, who works as the White House liaison for Homeland Security.</p>
<p>&quot;He should be fired from his current job within the administration,&quot; Schumer said after reading some of the text messages on the Senate floor. &quot;And he should never hold a position of leadership within the Republican Party or the government ever again.&quot;</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is scheduled to hear from Ingrassia on Thursday. It was unclear if anything on that front has changed with the panel&#x27;s chairman, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., saying &quot;we&#x27;re going to know more on Thursday.&quot;</p>
<p>The Office of Special Counsel is an investigative and prosecutorial office that works to protect government employees and whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. It&#x27;s also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers.</p>
<p>The office, now under the leadership of acting Director Jamieson Greer, confirmed in August that it was investigating former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith on allegations his investigation into Trump constituted political activity. Smith&#x27;s lawyers have said the investigation was &quot;wholly without merit,&quot; based on an &quot;imaginary and unfounded&quot; premise.</p>
<p>In May, Trump described Ingrassia in a social media post as a &quot;highly respected attorney, writer and Constitutional Scholar.&quot;</p>

<p>NEW DELHI (AP) - Millions of Indians celebrated Diwali on Monday as lamps illuminated homes and streets across the country to mark the Hindu festival symbolizing the victory of light over darkness.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump will host a Diwali celebration on Tuesday, 4 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above.</p>
<p>Diwali, derived from the word &quot;Deepavali,&quot; meaning &quot;a row of lights,&quot; is typically celebrated by socializing and exchanging gifts. The dates of the festival are based on the Hindu lunar calendar, typically falling in late October or early November.</p>
<p>Shoppers crowded markets to buy flowers, lanterns and candles.</p>
<p>The celebrations were most visible in Ayodhya city in Uttar Pradesh state. Hindus believe the deity Lord Ram was born there and returned after 14 years in exile. People light earthen lamps to mark his homecoming.</p>
<p>As dusk fell Sunday, more than 2.6 million lamps were lit on the banks of the Saryu River in Ayodhya, retaining the Guinness World Record set last year. At least 2,100 Hindu priests performed prayers in unison, their chants echoing across the shimmering riverfront.</p>
<p>The holy city was also decked with fairy lights, and a laser and fireworks show illuminated its lanes and riverbanks. Thousands of residents lit lamps at houses and temples.</p>
<p>Officials said more than 33,000 volunteers helped light the lamps. Nearly 40 families from nearby villages produced 1.6 million lamps. At least 73,000 liters of oil and 5.5 million cotton wicks were used to light the city.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard work lighting diyas (oil lamps) one by one,&quot; said 19-year-old volunteer Rachit Singh, his face glowing in the firelight. &quot;But when you see the whole ghat (stairs to the river) light up, every bit of effort feels worth it.&quot;</p>
<p>In recent years, Diwali celebrations in New Delhi have been clouded by concerns over air pollution, as smoke-emitting firecrackers cause toxic smog that can take days to clear.</p>
<p>On Monday, the level of tiniest particulates surged to 347 on the air quality index in parts of the city - about 14 times the World Health Organization&#x27;s daily recommended maximum exposure - according to SAFAR, the federal government&#x27;s air quality monitoring agency.</p>
<p>Last week, India&#x27;s top court eased a blanket ban on firecrackers in New Delhi during Diwali, allowing limited use of &quot;green firecrackers&quot; that emit fewer pollutants. Developed by federal research institutes, they are designed to cut particulate and gas emissions by about 30%.</p>
<p>The court said they could be used during specific hours from Saturday to Tuesday.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>In Chicago, an immense show of force signals a sharp escalation in Trump immigration crackdown</h2>

<p>CHICAGO (AP) - The music begins low and ominous, with the video showing searchlights skimming along a Chicago apartment building and heavily armed immigration agents storming inside. Guns are drawn. Unmarked cars fill the streets. Agents rappel from a Black Hawk helicopter.</p>
<p>But quickly the soundtrack grows more stirring and the video - edited into a series of dramatic shots and released by the Department of Homeland Security days after the Sept. 30 raid - shows agents leading away shirtless men, their hands zip-tied behind their backs.</p>
<p>Authorities said they were targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, though they also said only two of the 27 immigrants arrested were gang members. They gave few details on the arrests.</p>
<p>But the apartments of dozens of U.S. citizens were targeted, residents said, and at least a half-dozen Americans were held for hours.</p>
<p>The immense show of force signaled a sharp escalation in the White House&#x27;s immigration crackdown and amplified tensions in a city already on edge.</p>
<p>&quot;To every criminal illegal alien: Darkness is no longer your ally,&quot; Homeland Security said in a social media post accompanying the video, which racked up more than 6.4 million views. &quot;We will find you.&quot;</p>
<p>But Tony Wilson, a third-floor resident born and raised on Chicago&#x27;s South Side, sees only horror in what happened.</p>
<p>&quot;It was like we were under attack,&quot; Wilson said days after the raid, speaking through the hole where his door knob used to be. Agents had used a grinder to cut out the deadbolt, and he still couldn&#x27;t close the door properly, let alone lock it. So he had barricaded himself inside, blocking the door with furniture.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t even hear them knock or nothing,&quot; said Wilson, a 58-year-old U.S. citizen on disability.</p>
<p>The raid was executed in the heart of South Shore, an overwhelmingly Black neighborhood on Lake Michigan that has long been a tangle of middle-class dreams, urban decay and gentrification.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a place where teams of drug dealers troll for customers outside ornate lakeside apartment buildings. It has some of the city&#x27;s best vegan restaurants but also takeout places where the catfish fillets are ordered through bullet-proof glass.</p>
<p>It has well-paid professors from the University of Chicago but is also where one-third of households scrape by on less than $25,000 a year.</p>
<p>The apartment building where the raid occurred has long been troubled. Five stories tall and built in the 1950s, residents said it was often strewn with garbage, the elevators rarely worked and crime was a constant worry. Things had grown more chaotic after dozens of Venezuelan migrants arrived in the past few years, residents said. While no residents said they felt threatened by the migrants, many described a rise in noise and hallway trash.</p>
