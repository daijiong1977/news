There's no doubt that AI usage is increasing in the entertainment world and the best streaming services, but UK broadcaster Channel 4 has taken that one step further by unveiling Britain's first AI TV presenter.

In the new documentary Will AI Take My Job? Dispatches, which first aired on October 20, the presenter was revealed to be AI-generated in its closing moments. As our host tells us, "I'm not real. In a British TV first, I'm an AI presenter. Some of you might have guessed: I don't exist, I wasn't on location reporting this story. My image and voice were generated using AI."

Head of news and current affairs, specialist factual and sport at Channel 4 Louisa Compton added in a press statement: "The use of an AI presenter is not something we will be making a habit of at Channel 4 - instead our focus in news and current affairs is on premium, fact checked, duly impartial and trusted journalism - something AI is not capable of doing.

"But this stunt does serve as a useful reminder of just how disruptive AI has the potential to be - and how easy it is to hoodwink audiences with content they have no way of verifying."

Yet it's potentially too little, too late for Channel 4 to present such a real danger and immediately recant it. Viewers are already likening the experience to a Black Mirror episode, and I'm not buying it as a one-off experiment.

As one viewer said on X/Twitter: "A twist! In #Dispatches! It's like Black Mirror!" They're not wrong. The new documentary is crafted with more shrewd intent and cunning reveals than most TV shows or movies we've consumed in the last few years, and I think we'll take the wrong message away from it.

It's probably fairly clear by now, thanks to *gestures vaguely around*, that us humans don't have the best sense of judgement. As I wrote when AI actress Tilly Norwood began to make waves in Hollywood, "I can't help thinking of that viral quote from Joanna Maciejewska when it comes to the likes of Tilly Norwood: 'I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.'"

Where is Norwood now, other than an old news story we've already forgotten, lost in the never-ending digital cycle of information? My best guess is that we'll be outraged by Channel 4's stunt for all of 30 collective seconds before we forgivingly move on, forgetting it has ever happened at all.

Frankly, that's not good enough. Not only do we need to do more - industry professionals, media outlets, audiences, the lot - to get the best balance of AI in entertainment possible, but this stunt has likely opened the door for more talent to be generated rather than hired. As Norwood and Channel 4 have proved, we're at the tip of a dangerous iceberg.

Look through any TechRadar coverage by my brilliant colleagues and you will find many exceptional uses for AI, in and out of creative fields. However, AI is not needed when it comes to talent access or documentary storytelling. In fact, I'd say it's a case of less is more.

Let's strive to make fantastic creators' lives easier when it comes to making the things we love... not wiping them out altogether. I have a feeling I'll be saying this repeatedly, for many years to come, until I'm blue in the face.

Will AI Take My Job? Dispatches can be streamed on Channel 4 now in the UK, while international viewers needing a VPN to do so.

Notorious Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon has been once again linked to intrusions against telecommunications firms - this time in Europe.

A new report from Darktrace claims the group has been observed, "targeting global infrastructure using stealthy techniques such as DLL sideloading and zero-day exploits."

The early stage intrusion activity detected mirrors previous Salt Typhoon tactics, such as the prolific attacks on up to 8 different telecom organizations in a far reaching and potent multi-year campaign which resulted in the group stealing information from millions of American telecom customers using a high severity Cisco flaw to gain access and eventually collect traffic from the networks devices were connected to.

In the latest incident, Darktrace assessed with moderate confidence that Salt Typhoon abused legitimate tools with stealth and persistence - exploiting a Citrix NetScaler Gateway appliance to obtain initial access.

From there, the criminals deployed Snappybee malware, also known as Deed RAT, which is launched using a technique called DLL side-loading - another tactic commonly used by Chinese threat actors.

"The backdoor was delivered to these internal endpoints as a DLL alongside legitimate executable files for antivirus software such as Norton Antivirus, Bkav Antivirus, and IObit Malware Fighter," Darktrace explained.

"This pattern of activity indicates that the attacker relied on DLL side-loading via legitimate antivirus software to execute their payloads. Salt Typhoon and similar groups have a history of employing this technique, enabling them to execute payloads under the guise of trusted software and bypassing traditional security controls."

Darktrace says the intrusion was identified and remediated before it could escalate beyond the early stages of attack - neutralizing the threat.

This highlights the vital importance of proactive, anomaly-based defense and detection above the more traditional signature-based methods, especially given the rise in persistent, state sponsored threat actors.

Aura just branched out from making the best digital photo frames such as its Walden, to a completely new and power-efficient color e-paper type - the Aura Ink.

Announced and available from today for $499 at Aura Frames (UK and Australia pricing TBC), the Aura Ink is able to run for three months on a single charge, which means you can ditch ugly cables for a clean display on your wall or sideboard.

The E Ink Spectra™ 6 six-color display can render millions of tones for life-like color photos, with what Aura says is the 'warmth and subtleness of a printed photograph'.

A first for Aura, the Ink e-paper frame has a 13.3-inch display that's just 0.6-inches thick and is surrounded by a generous and attractive mount and frame.

Ink is supported by Aura's superb subscription-free app for remote image uploads. Having tested many digital photo frames, I can say that Aura's is one of the easiest apps to use.

Aura says it has advanced e-paper tech in the Ink with richer color and smarter lighting, which overcome the pitfalls of e-paper displays, namely images otherwise appearing dim.

Aura's dithering approach expands the six-color system into a vast number of tones, which are further boosted in contrast by a subtle built-in front light.

The result is a natural and bright paper-like display that gives off the feeling of a printed image, without the glaring glow of a standard digital photo frame.

And unlike digital photo frames, the Aura Ink is extremely power efficient - it'll run for up to three months on a full charge, so it can be placed without ugly trailing cables.

I already have my hands on the Aura Ink - it's certainly a high-end frame. Check back in soon for my full review for a classy frame that looks set to trouble our best digital photo frames guide.

Sony has released a brand new PlayStation 5 Pro, featuring several slight improvements from the original console, confirming rumors that the new model won't feature any major changes.

The details come from YouTuber Austin Evans(via PlayStationLifestyle), who got his hands on a new model and has conducted a thorough test to compare the latest console to the original.

While it appears from the outside that there are no major upgrades that would warrant you to trade in your old model, there are some slight differences that are worth noting.

For instance, the new PS5 Pro is lighter, coming in a 3016 grams, which is an 87 gram difference compared to the original's 3103 grams and mainly due to the changes made to the console's internal hardware components, specifically the motherboard, fan, and power supply.

On top of the console sounding quieter and running slightly cooler, it's also confirmed that the new model is between 2% and 3% more energy efficient than its original, as per the rumors. However, when tested against games like Astro's Playroom and Gran Turismo 7, Evans found a small improvement of 3% to 4%.

Another rumor also claimed that the new PS5 Pro will launch alongside a new DualSense wireless controller, which was said to feature a removable battery.

While the new console does come with the revised pad, with slight differences, it doesn't come with the removable battery component.

The official date for the grand OnePlus 15 unveiling has been set for Monday, October 27 (at least for the launch in China), and ahead of the event we're continuing to get details of the specs and features this flagship phone will bring with it.

OnePlus has now confirmed on Chinese social platform Weibo (via Notebookcheck) that the OnePlus 15 will come with a massive 7,300mAh battery. Charging rates are set at 120W for wired and 50W for wireless, which are also both very impressive.

That giant battery capacity had been mentioned in earlier leaks, but now we know it's coming. OnePlus has also gone on the record saying that we'll see a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset here, and a display with a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz.

In fact, there's not much left that isn't actually official. We're still not certain about the screen size, but a 6.78-inch panel has been rumored. The same batch of leaks also pointed towards a triple-lens 50MP+50MP+50MP camera on the rear of the phone.

So how does that 7,300mAh battery capacity compare to the other top flagships at the moment? Very well, actually: the recently-launched iPhone 17 Pro Max, for example, has a battery capacity of around 5,088mAh (Apple never lists specific capacities).

As per Apple, that phone can last for 37 hours between charges when playing videos, so the OnePlus 15 might even exceed that. Real world battery life depends on a variety of factors of course - but the size of the battery definitely plays a big role.

The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra carries a 5,000mAh battery, while the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 5,200mAh battery inside. The OnePlus 15 isn't just beating these competing flagships in terms of battery capacity, it's beating them by a clear margin.

We have seen phones with battery capacities as high as 33,000mAh in the past, so the OnePlus 15 won't be a record breaker - but those big battery phones are overly bulky and impractical for day-to-day use as a consumer flagship.
