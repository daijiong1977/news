        <div class="content">There's no doubt that AI usage is increasing in the entertainment world and the best streaming services, but UK broadcaster Channel 4 has taken that one step further by unveiling Britain's first AI TV presenter.

In the new documentary Will AI Take My Job? Dispatches, which first aired on October 20, the presenter was revealed to be AI-generated in its closing moments. As our host tells us, "I'm not real. In a British TV first, I'm an AI presenter. Some of you might have guessed: I don't exist, I wasn't on location reporting this story. My image and voice were generated using AI."

Head of news and current affairs, specialist factual and sport at Channel 4 Louisa Compton added in a press statement: "The use of an AI presenter is not something we will be making a habit of at Channel 4 - ins...</div>

        <div class="content">Salt Typhoon strikes again - but this time unsuccessfully

Notorious Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon has been once again linked to intrusions against telecommunications firms - this time in Europe.

A new report from Darktrace claims the group has been observed, "targeting global infrastructure using stealthy techniques such as DLL sideloading and zero-day exploits."

The early stage intrusion activity detected mirrors previous Salt Typhoon tactics, such as the prolific attacks on up to 8 different telecom organizations in a far reaching and potent multi-year campaign which resulted in the group stealing information from millions of American telecom customers using a high severity Cisco flaw to gain access and eventually collect traffic from the networks devices were connected to.

        <div class="content">The cable-free, natural-looking digital display your walls need

Aura just branched out from making the best digital photo frames such as its Walden, to a completely new and power-efficient color e-paper type - the Aura Ink.

Announced and available from today for $499 at Aura Frames (UK and Australia pricing TBC), the Aura Ink is able to run for three months on a single charge, which means you can ditch ugly cables for a clean display on your wall or sideboard.

The E Ink Spectra™ 6 six-color display can render millions of tones for life-like color photos, with what Aura says is the 'warmth and subtleness of a printed photograph'.

A first for Aura, the Ink e-paper frame has a 13.3-inch display that's just 0.6-inches thick and is surrounded by a generous and attractive mount and frame.

        <div class="content">Sony has released a brand new PlayStation 5 Pro, featuring several slight improvements from the original console, confirming rumors that the new model won't feature any major changes.

The details come from YouTuber Austin Evans(via PlayStationLifestyle), who got his hands on a new model and has conducted a thorough test to compare the latest console to the original.

While it appears from the outside that there are no major upgrades that would warrant you to trade in your old model, there are some slight differences that are worth noting.

For instance, the new PS5 Pro is lighter, coming in a 3016 grams, which is an 87 gram difference compared to the original's 3103 grams and mainly due to the changes made to the console's internal hardware components, specifically the motherboard, fan, a...</div>

        <div class="content">The official date for the grand OnePlus 15 unveiling has been set for Monday, October 27 (at least for the launch in China), and ahead of the event we're continuing to get details of the specs and features this flagship phone will bring with it.

OnePlus has now confirmed on Chinese social platform Weibo (via Notebookcheck) that the OnePlus 15 will come with a massive 7,300mAh battery. Charging rates are set at 120W for wired and 50W for wireless, which are also both very impressive.

That giant battery capacity had been mentioned in earlier leaks, but now we know it's coming. OnePlus has also gone on the record saying that we'll see a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset here, and a display with a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz.

In fact, there's not much left that isn't actually official. We'...</div>
