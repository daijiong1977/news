    <p>Ruling holds that defeating end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp harms Meta's business.

A federal judge has ordered spyware maker NSO to stop using its Pegasus app to target or infect users of WhatsApp. The ruling, issued Friday by Phyllis J. Hamilton of the US District Court of the District of Northern California, grants a permanent injunction sought by WhatsApp owner Meta in a case it brought against NSO in 2019. The lawsuit alleged that Meta caught NSO trying to surreptitiously infect about 1,400 mobile phones-many belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials-with Pegasus. As part of the campaign, NSO created fake WhatsApp accounts and targeted Meta infrastructure. The suit sought monetary awards and</p>

      <li><strong>easy</strong>: <em>Court Bans Spyware Company from Hacking WhatsApp Users</em>
        <div>A US court has permanently banned a spyware company called NSO from targeting WhatsApp users. The company was using a program called Pegasus to secretly hack into people's phones through WhatsApp. The court ruled that NSO must stop trying to infect WhatsApp users' devices and must delete any information they already stole. The judge said that protecting WhatsApp's security was more important than NSO's business interests. This case started in 2019 when WhatsApp's owner Meta discovered that NSO was trying to hack about 1,400 phones belonging to journalists, activists, and government officials. The court decided that breaking WhatsApp's encryption to spy on people was harmful and illegal.</div>

      <li><strong>mid</strong>: <em>Federal Court Issues Permanent Ban on NSO's Pegasus Targeting of WhatsApp</em>
        <div>A landmark federal court ruling has permanently barred Israeli spyware firm NSO Group from using its Pegasus software to target WhatsApp users or compromise Meta's infrastructure. US District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton granted Meta's request for a permanent injunction in a case dating back to 2019, when Meta discovered NSO attempting to infect approximately 1,400 mobile devices belonging to journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior government officials. The sophisticated attack involved creating fake WhatsApp accounts and targeting Meta's infrastructure to bypass the app's end-to-end encryption, which uses the open-source Signal Protocol. The court ordered NSO to cease all attempts to target WhatsApp users, infect their devices, or intercept encrypted messages, and required the company to delete any data obtained through these methods. NSO argued that such restrictions would effectively put them out of business since Pegasus represents their flagship product, but Judge Hamilton determined that the harm to Meta's business and user security outweighed these commercial concerns. The ruling establishes important precedent regarding corporate responsibility in protecting encrypted communications and sets boundaries for surveillance technology companies operating in global markets.</div>

      <li><strong>hard</strong>: <em>Federal Court's Permanent Injunction Against NSO Establishes Precedent for Corporate Accountability in Digital Surveillance</em>
        <div>In a landmark decision with far-reaching implications for the surveillance technology industry, US District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton has issued a permanent injunction prohibiting NSO Group from utilizing its Pegasus spyware to target WhatsApp users or compromise Meta's infrastructure. The ruling culminates a four-year legal battle initiated by Meta in 2019 after discovering NSO's sophisticated campaign to infect approximately 1,400 mobile devices belonging to journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials. The court found that NSO employed advanced techniques including creating counterfeit WhatsApp accounts and directly targeting Meta's infrastructure to circumvent the platform's end-to-end encryption, which employs the open-source Signal Protocol. Judge Hamilton's comprehensive order mandates that NSO permanently cease all attempts to target WhatsApp users, infect their devices, intercept encrypted communications, and requires the immediate deletion of any data obtained through these illicit means. Crucially, the court rejected NSO's argument that such restrictions would effectively destroy their business model, determining that the substantial harm inflicted upon Meta's encryption-based services and user trust outweighed any commercial considerations. This ruling establishes significant legal precedent regarding corporate accountability in the digital surveillance sphere, potentially influencing future cases involving surveillance technology companies and their obligations to respect platform security and user privacy. The decision also reinforces the legal standing of technology companies to protect their encryption infrastructure from external compromise, setting important boundaries for the rapidly evolving surveillance technology market.</div>

      <li><strong>hard</strong>: <em>联邦法院对NSO的永久禁令为数字监控中的企业责任确立先例</em>
        <div>在一项对监控技术行业具有深远影响的里程碑式裁决中，美国地区法官Phyllis J. Hamilton发布了永久禁令，禁止NSO集团使用其飞马间谍软件针对WhatsApp用户或破坏Meta的基础设施。这一裁决结束了始于2019年的四年法律斗争，当时Meta发现NSO开展了一项复杂的攻击活动，试图感染约1,400台移动设备，这些设备属于记者、人权活动人士、政治异见者、外交官和外国政府高级官员。法院认定NSO采用了先进技术，包括创建假冒WhatsApp账户和直接攻击Meta的基础设施，以绕过该平台使用开源Signal协议的端到端加密。Hamilton法官的全面命令要求NSO永久停止所有针对WhatsApp用户的尝试、感染其设备、拦截加密通信的行为，并要求立即删除通过这些非法手段获取的任何数据。关键的是，法院驳回了NSO关于此类限制将有效摧毁其商业模式的论点，认定对Meta基于加密的服务和用户信任造成的实质性损害超过了任何商业考量。这一裁决在数字监控领域确立了关于企业责任的重要法律先例，可能影响未来涉及监控技术公司及其尊重平台安全和用户隐私义务的案件。该决定还强化了科技公司保护其加密基础设施免受外部破坏的法律地位，为快速发展的监控技术市场设定了重要边界。此案凸显了商业监控技术与数字隐私权之间的持续紧张关系，同时提出了关于在数字时代平衡安全利益与执法合法需求的重要问题。裁决的影响可能超越本案，为全球范围内类似的法律挑战提供参考框架，并可能促使其他科技公司采取更积极的法律行动来保护其平台完整性。</div>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> I went hands-on with Samsung's Galaxy XR – aka Project Moohan – a spatial computer that comes in cheaper and far more AI-ready than Apple's Vision Pro.</p>
    <p>The Samsung Galaxy XR is here, and it instantly raises the bar for spatial computing in three crucial elements: price, intelligence, and comfort.
Formerly known as Project Moohan, the XR headset is the product of some deep collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm. In some ways, the Galaxy XR represents the best of each company: it's a showcase for Samsung's design and R&D expertise, Google's powerhouse generative AI efforts, and Qualcomm's ever-growing mobile SoC capabilities.
Remarkably, the Galaxy XR headset arrives in the US and Korea priced at just $1,799 (availability and pricing for other regions is TBC, but that price converts to about £1,340 or AU$2,770). I know, that's not cheap, but it's a positive bargain compared to the Apple Vision Pro, which is still listed for $</p>
