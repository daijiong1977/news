                            <p>All the world’s discarded phones, bricked laptops, and other trashed electronics are collectively a treasure trove of rare earth elements (REEs). But separating out and recovering these increasingly sought-after materials is no easy task.</p>
<p>However, a team of researchers says it has developed a way of separating REEs from waste—magnets, in this case—that is relatively easy, uses less energy, and isn’t nearly as emissions and pollution intensive as current methods. The team published <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2507819122">a paper</a> describing this method in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>In short, this process involves using an electric current to heat waste magnets to very high temperatures very fast, and using chlorine gas to react with the non-REEs in the mix, keeping them in the vapor phase. James Tour, one of the authors and a professor of materials science and nanoengineering at Rice University, says that the research can help the United States meet its growing need for these elements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/breaking-down-rare-earth-element-magnets-for-recycling/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <p>Chances are you’ve encountered some version of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebbinghaus_illusion">Ebbinghaus illusion</a>,” in which a central circle appears to be smaller when encircled by larger circles and seems larger when surrounded by smaller circles. It’s an example of context-dependent size perception. But is this unique to humans or are some animals susceptible as well? According to a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1653695/full">new paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, it might depend on the specific sensory environment, since the illusion relies on contextual clues to be effective.</p>
<p>Prior research has produced mixed results on the question of animals and their susceptibility to optical illusions, per the authors. Dolphins, chicks, and redtail splitfins seem to be susceptible, for example, while pigeons, baboons, and gray bamboo snakes are not.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best-known example is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/what-cats-love-of-boxes-and-squares-can-tell-us-about-their-visual-perception/">cats’ undeniable love of boxes</a> and squares—the “if it fits, I sits” phenomenon documented all over the Internet. This behavior is <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-cant-cats-resist-thinking-inside-the-box-76287">generally attributed</a> to the fact that cats feel safer when squeezed into small spaces, but it also tells us something about feline visual perception. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3250081/">A 1988 study</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159121001258?fbclid=IwAR0NkvhAGEDRgD4xwynVFuaXl6JUFZ0ZSgDYNJH7tEwiPIMZrYv7tkxUoIw">a 2021 study</a> concluded that cats are susceptible to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_contour">Kanizsa square illusion</a>, suggesting that they perceive subjective contours much like humans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/do-animals-fall-for-optical-illusions-its-complicated/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <p>In 1890, a German scientist named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Koch">Robert Koch</a> thought he’d invented a cure for tuberculosis, a substance derived from the infecting bacterium itself that he dubbed Tuberculin. His substance didn’t actually cure anyone, but it was eventually widely used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin">diagnostic skin test</a>. Koch’s successful failure is just one of the many colorful cases featured in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Ends-Failures-Sparked-Medical/dp/1547615028"><em>Dead Ends! Flukes, Flops, and Failures</em> <em>that Sparked Medical Marvels</em></a>, a new nonfiction illustrated children’s book by science historian Lindsey Fitzharris and her husband, cartoonist Adrian Teal.</p>
<p>A noted science communicator with a fondness for the medically macabre, Fitzharris published a biography of surgical pioneer Joseph Lister, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374117292/?ots=1&amp;slotNum=0&amp;imprToken=26c0af77-ed11-8f74-19c&amp;tag=arstech20-20" rel="nofollow" data-orig-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374117292/?ots=1&amp;slotNum=0&amp;imprToken=26c0af77-ed11-8f74-19c&amp;tag=arstech20-20" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-uri="ad6f0422bfaaccb498271fe8ac321b3d" data-xid="fr1760646290574dbd"><em>The Butchering Art</em></a>, in 2017—a great, if occasionally grisly, read. She followed up with 2022’s  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facemaker-Visionary-Surgeons-Disfigured-Soldiers/dp/0374282307"><em>The Facemaker: A Visionary Surgeon’s Battle to Mend the Disfigured Soldiers of World War I</em></a>, about a WWI surgeon named Harold Gillies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/meet-harold-gillies-the-wwi-surgeon-who-rebuilt-the-faces-of-injured-soldiers/">who rebuilt</a> the faces of injured soldiers.</p>
<p>And in 2020, she hosted a documentary for the Smithsonian Channel, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/famous-strange-demises-get-a-second-look-in-the-curious-life-and-death-of/"><em>The Curious Life and Death Of</em></a>…, exploring famous deaths, ranging from drug lord Pablo Escobar to magician Harry Houdini. Fitzharris performed virtual autopsies, experimented with blood samples, interviewed witnesses, and conducted real-time demonstrations in hopes of gleaning fresh insights. For his part, Teal is a well-known caricaturist and illustrator, best known for his work on the British TV series <em>Spitting Image</em>. His work has also appeared in The Guardian and the Sunday Telegraph, among other outlets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/dead-ends-is-a-fun-macabre-medical-history-for-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <p>The Orion spacecraft, which will fly four people around the Moon, arrived inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida late Thursday night, ready to be stacked on top of its rocket for launch early next year.</p>
<p>The late-night transfer covered about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from one facility to another at the Florida spaceport. NASA and its contractors are continuing preparations for the Artemis II mission after the White House approved the program as an exception to work through the ongoing government shutdown, which began on October 1.</p>
<p>The sustained work could set up Artemis II for a launch opportunity as soon as February 5 of next year. Astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen will be the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/in-their-own-words-the-artemis-ii-crew-on-the-frenetic-first-hours-of-their-flight/">first humans to fly on the Orion spacecraft</a>, a vehicle that has been in development for nearly two decades.

                            <p>Our hominid ancestors faced a Pleistocene world full of dangers—and apparently one of those dangers was lead poisoning.</p>
<p>Lead exposure sounds like a modern problem, at least if you define “modern” the way a paleoanthropologist might: a time that started a few thousand years ago with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/greenland-ice-cores-track-roman-lead-pollution-in-year-by-year-detail/">ancient Roman silver smelting</a> and lead pipes. According to a recent study, however, lead is a much more ancient nemesis, one that predates not just the Romans but the existence of our genus <i>Homo</i>. Paleoanthropologist Renaud Joannes-Boyau of Australia’s Southern Cross University and his colleagues found evidence of exposure to dangerous amounts of lead in the teeth of fossil apes and hominins dating back almost 2 million years. And somewhat controversially, they suggest that the toxic element’s pervasiveness may have helped shape our evolutionary history.</p>

<h2>The Romans didn’t invent lead poisoning</h2>
<p>Joannes-Boyau and his colleagues took tiny samples of preserved enamel and dentin from the teeth of 51 fossils. In most of those teeth, the paleoanthropologists found evidence that these apes and hominins had been exposed to lead—sometimes in dangerous quantities—fairly often during their early years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/hominins-suffered-lead-poisoning-starting-at-least-2-million-years-ago/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <p>A federal judge has ordered spyware maker <a href="https://www.nsogroup.com/">NSO</a> to stop using its Pegasus app to target or infect users of WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.350613/gov.uscourts.cand.350613.802.0.pdf">ruling</a>, issued Friday by Phyllis J. Hamilton of of the US District Court of the District of Northern California, grants a permanent injunction sought by WhatsApp owner Meta in a case it brought against NSO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/">in 2019</a>. The lawsuit alleged that Meta caught NSO trying to surreptitiously infect about 1,400 mobile phones—many belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials—with Pegasus. As part of the campaign, NSO created fake WhatsApp accounts and targeted Meta infrastructure. The suit sought monetary awards and an injunction against the practice.</p>
<h2>Setting a precedent</h2>
<p>Friday’s ruling ordered NSO to permanently cease targeting WhatsApp users, attempting to infect their devices, or intercepted WhatsApp messages, which are end-to-end encrypted using the open source <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/why-signals-post-quantum-makeover-is-an-amazing-engineering-achievement/">Signal Protocol</a>. Hamilton also ruled that NSO must delete any data it obtained when targeting the WhatsApp users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/nso-permanently-barred-from-targeting-whatsapp-users-with-pegasus-spyware/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <p>NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy made two television appearances on Monday morning in which he shook up the space agency’s plans to return humans to the Moon.</p>
<p>Speaking on Fox News, where the secretary of transportation frequently appears in his acting role as NASA chief, Duffy said SpaceX has fallen behind in its efforts to develop the Starship vehicle as a lunar lander. Duffy also indirectly acknowledged that NASA’s projected target of a 2027 crewed lunar landing is no longer achievable. Accordingly, he said he intended to expand the competition to develop a lander capable of carrying humans down to the Moon from lunar orbit and back.</p>
<p>“They’re behind schedule, and so the President wants to make sure we beat the Chinese,” <a href="https://x.com/SecDuffyNASA/status/1980243865400701369">Duffy said</a> of SpaceX. “He wants to get there in his term. So I’m in the process of opening that contract up. I think we’ll see companies like Blue [Origin] get involved, and maybe others. We’re going to have a space race in regard to American companies competing to see who can actually lead us back to the Moon first.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/nasas-acting-leader-seeks-to-keep-his-job-with-new-lunar-lander-announcement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <p>Anthropic has <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-on-the-web">added web and mobile interfaces</a> for Claude Code, its immensely popular command-line interface (CLI) agentic AI coding tool.</p>
<p>The web interface appears to be well-baked at launch, but the mobile version is limited to iOS and is in an earlier stage of development.</p>
<p>The web version of Claude Code can be given access to a GitHub repository. Once that’s done, developers can give it general marching orders like “add real-time inventory tracking to the dashboard.” As with the CLI version, it gets to work, with updates along the way approximating where it’s at and what it’s doing. The web interface supports the recently implemented Claude Code capability to take suggestions or requested changes while it’s in the middle of working on a task. (Previously, if you saw it doing something wrong or missing something, you often had to cancel and start over.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <p>It took awhile, but Google’s Pixel line of smartphones has established itself as a mainstay of Android after 10 generations. The company has long operated a “Superfans” group to help promote Pixels, but now members have a slim chance to get their hands on Google’s next phones ahead of time. Google is reportedly looking for some lucky Superfans to test and provide feedback on unreleased devices, but they’ll have to promise not to leak anything.</p>
<p>It’s not unheard of for companies to have loyal customers help test new products, but it’s not usually big companies like Google with well-established products like Pixel. Google usually keeps its circle of hardware testers small and limited to employees. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-20/google-to-let-superfans-test-pixel-11-before-it-s-announced">According to Bloomberg</a>, Google is running a contest among Superfans to find 15 non-employees suited to test in-development hardware. An official document reviewed by Bloomberg describes the program as a chance to “provide feedback and help shape a Pixel phone currently in development.”</p>
<p>To apply, interested Superfans have to prove they are more super than the rest. They must demonstrate deep knowledge of the Pixel product family and suggest ways the phones can be improved. However, Google is asking this of its biggest supporters—people who still care enough about their smartphones to seek out a group specifically to talk about how much they care about their phones. Is Google going to get gushing praise or constructive criticism?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-reportedly-searching-for-15-pixel-superfans-to-test-unreleased-phones/">Read full article</a></p>
