<div class="content">Ig Nobel-winning research could one day be used to treat people with blocked airways or clogged lungs.

Last year, a group of researchers won the 2024 Ig Nobel Prize in Physiology for discovering that many mammals are capable of breathing through their anus. But as with many Ig Nobel awards, there is a serious side to the seeming silliness. The same group has conducted a new study on the feasibility of adapting this method to treat people with blocked airways or clogged lungs, with promising results that bring rectal oxygen delivery one step closer to medical reality.

As previously reported, this is perhaps one of the more unusual research developments to come out of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated shortages of ventilators and artificial lungs to assist patients&#x27; breathing and prevent respiratory failure. The Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital Medical Center team took their inspiration from the humble loach, a freshwater bottom-dwelling fish found throughout Eurasia and northern Africa. The loach (along with sea cucumbers) employs intestinal breathing (i.e., through the anus) rather than gills to survive under hypoxic conditions, thanks to having lots of capillary vessels in its intestine. The technical term is enteral ventilation via anus (EVA).

Would such a novel breathing method work in mammals? The team thought it might be possible and undertook experiments with mice and micro-pigs to test that hypothesis. They drew upon earlier research by Leland Clark, also of Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital, who invented a perfluorocarbon liquid called Oxycyte as a possible form of artificial blood. That vision never materialized, although it did provide a handy plot point for the 1989 film The Abyss, in which a rat is able to &quot;breathe&quot; in a similar liquid.

And Oxycyte was ideal for the group&#x27;s 2021 Ig Nobel-winning efforts. The experiments involved intra-anally administering oxygen gas or a liquid oxygenated perfluorocarbon to the unfortunate rodents and porcines. Yes, they gave the animals enemas. They then induced respiratory failure and evaluated the effectiveness of the intra-anal treatment. The result: Both treatments were pretty darned effective at staving off respiratory failure with no major complications.

So far, so good. The next logical step was to determine if EVA could work in human patients, too. &quot;Patients with severe respiratory failure often need mechanical ventilation to survive, but these therapies can cause further lung injury,&quot; the authors wrote in this latest paper. EVA &quot;could give the lungs a chance to rest and heal.&quot;

The team recruited 27 healthy adult men in Japan, each of whom received a dose of non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin via the anus. They were asked to retain the liquid for a full hour as the dosage slowly increased from 25 to 1,500 mL. Twenty of the men successfully completed the experiment. Apart from mild temporary abdominal bloating and discomfort-which proved to be dosage dependent and resolved with no need for medical attention-they experienced no adverse effects.

&quot;This is the first human data and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,&quot; said co-author Takanori Takebe of Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital and the University of Osaka in Japan. &quot;But now that we have established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream.&quot;

<div class="content">New method extracts desirable elements from waste magnets using less energy and acid.

All the world&#x27;s discarded phones, bricked laptops, and other trashed electronics are collectively a treasure trove of rare earth elements (REEs). But separating out and recovering these increasingly sought-after materials is no easy task.

However, a team of researchers says it has developed a way of separating REEs from waste-magnets, in this case-that is relatively easy, uses less energy, and isn&#x27;t nearly as emissions and pollution intensive as current methods. The team published a paper describing this method in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In short, this process involves using an electric current to heat waste magnets to very high temperatures very fast, and using chlorine gas to react with the non-REEs in the mix, keeping them in the vapor phase. James Tour, one of the authors and a professor of materials science and nanoengineering at Rice University, says that the research can help the United States meet its growing need for these elements.

&quot;The country&#x27;s scurrying to try to see how we can get these [REEs],&quot; he says. &quot;And, in our argument, it&#x27;s all in our waste... We have it right here, just pull it right back out of the waste.&quot;

In 2018, Tour and his colleagues discovered that this rapid heating process, called flash joule heating, can turn any carbon source-including coal, biochar, and mixed plastic-into graphene, a very thin, strong, and conductive material.

Building on this, in 2023, they developed a method that uses flash joule heating and chlorine. In this work, they identified the Gibbs free energy, the reactivity of a material, for the oxide form of all 17 REEs and nine common oxides found in REE waste.

Ground-up waste magnets are put on a platform made of carbon and surrounded by a glass chamber. A current runs through the platform, rapidly producing immense heat, thousands of degrees celsius in a matter of seconds. Chlorine gas is then released into the chamber, creating chlorides of unwanted elements like iron and lowering their boiling points.

Between the chlorine gas and the heat, the non-REE components vaporize and form deposits on the interior of the chamber. The REEs are left behind in oxide or oxychloride form on the carbon platform, ready to be collected.

The team studied the differences in reactivity with chlorine gas and the difference of boiling points between the oxide and chloride forms of the metals-iron&#x27;s boiling point is around 3,000° C, while iron chloride&#x27;s boiling point is only 315° C-as they &quot;probed around&quot; and tested different voltages and temperatures on neodymium-iron-boron and samarium-cobalt magnet waste.

Because magnets are hard, they were heated to 800° C to demagnetize and soften them prior to grinding them to dust. The separated REE residue at the end of the process can be remagnetized by exposing them to a magnet.

The end result is more than 90 percent pure and recovers more than 90 percent of the REEs from the waste magnets. Tour adds that the method could be used on different forms of e-waste, not just magnets.

Tour and his colleagues also ran a life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis, comparing their method to a common method of recovering REEs from waste. Called hydrometallurgical extraction, it requires a fair amount of energy and the use of a lot of acids and solvents. &quot;It&#x27;s a messy, messy process,&quot; he says.

The team&#x27;s analysis suggests that the method involving Fast Joule Heating and chlorine gas reduces energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission, and operating costs by 87, 84, and 54 percent, respectively.

In 2022 alone, the world produced 66.2 million tonnes of this e-waste. Metal, unlike plastic, is infinitely recyclable, and the concentration of REEs in e-waste is much higher than occurs naturally. The two main ways of mining REEs both release toxic chemicals into surrounding environments. Setting up a mine is also very expensive, Tour adds.</div>

<div class="content">Ruling holds that defeating end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp harms Meta&#x27;s business.

A federal judge has ordered spyware maker NSO to stop using its Pegasus app to target or infect users of WhatsApp.

The ruling, issued Friday by Phyllis J. Hamilton of the US District Court of the District of Northern California, grants a permanent injunction sought by WhatsApp owner Meta in a case it brought against NSO in 2019. The lawsuit alleged that Meta caught NSO trying to surreptitiously infect about 1,400 mobile phones-many belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials-with Pegasus. As part of the campaign, NSO created fake WhatsApp accounts and targeted Meta infrastructure. The suit sought monetary awards and an injunction against the practice.

Friday&#x27;s ruling ordered NSO to permanently cease targeting WhatsApp users, attempting to infect their devices, or intercepting WhatsApp messages, which are end-to-end encrypted using the open source Signal Protocol. Hamilton also ruled that NSO must delete any data it obtained when targeting the WhatsApp users.

NSO had argued that such a ruling would &quot;force NSO out of business,&quot; as Pegasus is its &quot;flagship product.&quot; Hamilton ruled that the harm Pegasus posed to Meta outweighed any such considerations.

&quot;In the court&#x27;s view, any business that deals with users&#x27; personal information, and that invests resources into ways to encrypt that personal information, is harmed by the unauthorized access of that personal information-and it is more than just a reputational harm, it&#x27;s a business harm,&quot; Hamilton wrote. &quot;Essentially, part of what companies such as Whatsapp are &#x27;selling&#x27; is informational privacy, and any unauthorized access is an interference with that sale. Defendants&#x27; conduct serves to defeat one of the purposes of the service being offered by plaintiffs, which constitutes direct harm.&quot;

The judge went on to deny Meta&#x27;s request that the injunction bar foreign governments that may use WhatsApp. She said that sovereign governments weren&#x27;t parties to the lawsuit. Friday&#x27;s ruling also denied Meta&#x27;s request that the injunction bar NSO from targeting users of other Meta properties such as Facebook and Instagram on the grounds there was no evidence presented concerning targeting of them.

&quot;Today&#x27;s ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again,&quot; WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said in a statement. &quot;We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society. It sets an important precedent that there are serious consequences to attacking an American company.&quot;

Hamilton also slashed the punitive damages a jury awarded to Meta from $167 million to $4 million. The judge said the standard the jury based the amount on wasn&#x27;t proper. Under the correct standard, punitive damages must be capped at $4 million, she said.

We welcome the court&#x27;s decision to accept NSO&#x27;s position and to drastically reduce the punitive damages by more than 97 percent compared to the excessive amount originally awarded by the jury. While the remaining sum is still disproportionately high, this significant reduction marks a step in the right direction.

The statement also applauded the narrowing of the injunction Meta requested to excluse NSO customers.

Pegasus is among the most advanced means of surveilling iPhones and Android devices. Pegasus often infects devices using &quot;zero-click&quot; exploits, meaning they require no interaction on the part of targeted users. Both Apple and Google expend significant resources to secure their operating systems; Pegasus defeats these defenses by spending large sums reverse-engineering the OSes.

NSO has said that it licenses Pegasus only to governments that a careful vetting shows don&#x27;t abuse their use of the spyware. As was demonstrated in the WhatsApp case, dissidents, journalists, and others have been targeted anyway.

The ruling is significant because, as Cathcart noted, it sets a precedent that other US parties who are in the same position as Meta can cite in any cases they bring against NSO.

<div class="content">Malicious payloads stored on Ethereum and BNB blockchains are immune to takedowns.

Hacking groups-at least one of which works on behalf of the North Korean government-have found a new and inexpensive way to distribute malware from &quot;bulletproof&quot; hosts: stashing them on public cryptocurrency blockchains.

In a Thursday post, members of the Google Threat Intelligence Group said the technique provides the hackers with their own &quot;bulletproof&quot; host, a term that describes cloud platforms that are largely immune from takedowns by law enforcement and pressure from security researchers. More traditionally, these hosts are located in countries without treaties agreeing to enforce criminal laws from the US and other nations. These services often charge hefty sums and cater to criminals spreading malware or peddling child sexual abuse material and wares sold in crime-based flea markets.

Since February, Google researchers have observed two groups turning to a newer technique to infect targets with credential stealers and other forms of malware. The method, known as EtherHiding, embeds the malware in smart contracts, which are essentially apps that reside on blockchains for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Two or more parties then enter into an agreement spelled out in the contract. When certain conditions are met, the apps enforce the contract terms in a way that, at least theoretically, is immutable and independent of any central authority.

&quot;In essence, EtherHiding represents a shift toward next-generation bulletproof hosting, where the inherent features of blockchain technology are repurposed for malicious ends,&quot; Google researchers Blas Kojusner, Robert Wallace, and Joseph Dobson wrote. &quot;This technique underscores the continuous evolution of cyber threats as attackers adapt and leverage new technologies to their advantage.&quot;

There&#x27;s a wide array of advantages to EtherHiding over more traditional means of delivering malware, which besides bulletproof hosting include leveraging compromised servers.

Creating or modifying smart contracts typically cost less than $2 per transaction, a huge savings in terms of funds and labor over more traditional methods for delivering malware.

Layered on top of the EtherHiding Google observed was a social-engineering campaign that used recruiting for fake jobs to lure targets, many of whom were developers of cryptocurrency apps or other online services. During the screening process, candidates must perform a test demonstrating their coding or code-review skills. The files required to complete the tests are embedded with malicious code.

The infection process relies on a chain of malware that gets installed in stages. Later stages responsible for executing the final payloads are then installed through smart contracts that the hackers store on the Ethereum and the BNB Smart Chain blockchains, which accept uploads from anyone.

One of the groups Google observed, a North Korean-backed team tracked as UNC5342, uses earlier-stage malware tracked as JadeSnow to retrieve later-stage malware from both the BNB and Ethereum blockchains. The Google researchers observed:

It is unusual to see a threat actor make use of multiple blockchains for EtherHiding activity; this may indicate operational compartmentalization between teams of North Korean cyber operators. Lastly, campaigns frequently leverage EtherHiding&#x27;s flexible nature to update the infection chain and shift payload delivery locations. In one transaction, the JADESNOW downloader can switch from fetching a payload on Ethereum to fetching it on the BNB Smart Chain. This switch not only complicates analysis but also leverages lower transaction fees offered by alternate networks.

The researchers said they also observed another group, the financially motivated UNC5142, also employing EtherHiding.

North Korea&#x27;s hacking prowess was once considered low caliber. Over the past decade, the country has mounted a series of high-profile attack campaigns that demonstrate growing skill, focus, and resources. Two weeks ago, blockchain analysis firm Elliptic said the nation has stolen cryptocurrency valued at more than $2 billion so far in 2025.

<div class="content">Laura Muir split with her former coach Andrew Young in 2023

Olympic silver medallist Laura Muir has said she has put a &quot;difficult chapter firmly behind&quot; her after her former coach Andrew Young was banned for three years for &quot;serious misconduct&quot;.

A UK Athletics disciplinary panel found that Young - who Scotland&#x27;s Muir stopped working with in 2023 - &quot;ignored medical advice&quot; and &quot;used manipulative and coercive behaviour towards those he coached&quot;.

One incident highlighted was when Young, &quot;following a disagreement, drove at speed with an athlete in his car before abandoning them at the roadside, disregarding their safety and wellbeing&quot;.

Other examples included &quot;requiring an athlete to compete against the clear advice of a physiotherapist, threatening to exclude athletes from training or races if they did not comply with his demands, and emotionally undermining those who raised concerns about injuries&quot;.

Young faced 39 charges and, in September 2024, a UKA disciplinary panel found nine of those proven &quot;wholly or in part&quot;, with seven of them serious.

He was then suspended for five years in a ban backdated to April 2023.

Young appealed against the ruling and, while an independent panel expressed &quot;a slightly lesser view of the gravity of the misconduct overall&quot; in August 2025 and reduced his ban to three years, &quot;it rejected claims of bias, legal error and unfairness, and it confirmed the misconduct findings in full&quot;.

&quot;It agreed that seven of the breaches were serious and that revocation of his licence was necessary to protect athletes,&quot; said UKA.

The governing body also said that Young would be required to &quot;complete training on athlete welfare, injury management and bullying/harassment before a return to coaching could be considered&quot;.

Muir, who won a silver medal in the 1,500m at the Olympics in Tokyo in 2021, is now being coached by Laura Weightman, while world indoor silver medallist Jemma Reekie - who had also been coached by Young - is now working with Jon Bigg.

&quot;I have chosen to waive my anonymity and confirm my involvement in this case,&quot; said Muir.

&quot;I fully support the decisions reached by both independent panels and I am grateful that the process has been followed through so thoroughly.

&quot;I want to thank those who came forward and those who contributed to the process - it has not been easy, but it was necessary.

&quot;Athletics has always been my passion, and I am pleased to say that I have rediscovered the love of my sport and the enjoyment of training and working within a supportive and positive coaching environment.</div>

<div class="content">The head of global theme park giant Merlin Entertainments says its &quot;biggest competition&quot; is people choosing to stay at home on their phones and other devices.

Fiona Eastwood says a day out at one of its UK attractions - which include Legoland, Thorpe Park and Alton Towers - was the &quot;perfect antidote&quot; for spiralling screen time.

Eastwood also highlighted the importance of seasonal attractions to its customers - with Halloween now rivalling its summer season in driving profits at some attractions.

Having been in the job since February, Eastwood has taken over at a time when her industry is facing challenges from a dip in consumer confidence.

Her company&#x27;s latest half-year update flagged concerns over a &quot;softening of demand&quot; in the UK theme park sector and fewer international visitors.

Last year the company&#x27;s overall revenue was down slightly to just over £2bn, with an operating loss of £132m.

Despite the challenging environment, Merlin drew just shy of 63 million people to its attractions in 2024. Escapism was something people were willing to spend on, Eastood says.

&quot;The moments to be together are increasingly precious, and what we provide is quite distinct,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#x27;s all about families coming together to play.&quot;

Talking about its UK attractions, which include Madame Tussauds, Sea Life and the London Eye, Eastwood says seasonal windows are key.

Its major theme parks have hosted Halloween events, like Scarefest at Alton Towers and Fright Nights at Thorpe Park, since 2002.

&quot;We&#x27;re a very seasonally led business,&quot; says Eastwood. &quot;So you have spring break, Easter, summer and Halloween.

&quot;Halloween, that we&#x27;re in now, we&#x27;re seeing some really strong performance. That&#x27;s in view of the amazing product we have. You take Thorpe Park, increasingly Halloween is almost half of its annual profits.&quot;

Along with seasonal offerings, big brand partnerships are also a key part of Merlin Entertainments&#x27; strategy - creating rides themed around children&#x27;s tv hits to tempt families away from their screens and into the parks.

Next year it will open its first Bluey ride at Alton Towers as part of CBeebies land, as well as PAW Patrol land opening at Chessington World of Adventures.

One of next year&#x27;s biggest launches is a collaboration with video game Minecraft - an enduring mega hit since it was launched in 2009, spawning one of the highest grossing films of 2025.</div>

<div class="content">The collapse of two US companies could be a sign of wider problems in the financial system and &quot;alarm bells&quot; were ringing, the governor of the Bank of England has said.

Andrew Bailey told a House of Lords committee that it was important to take the failure of car parts supplier First Brands and subprime car lender Tricolor &quot;very seriously&quot; - and drew parallels with the 2008 financial crisis.

He said it was unclear whether these were one-off issues, or a case of &quot;the canary in the coal mine&quot;.

Mr Bailey also said the Bank of England was planning to run a &quot;stress test&quot; of private equity and credit firms.

The bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor have raised questions about the quality of deals in what is known as the private credit market - where companies arrange loans from non-bank lenders.

Mr Bailey said he did not want &quot;to sound too foreboding at this point&quot;, but that &quot;there is a lot we don&#x27;t know about First Brands and Tricolour&quot;.

&quot;I think the big question... is: are these cases idiosyncratic, or are they what I call the canary in the coalmine?

&quot;Are they telling us something more fundamental about the private finance and private assets sector?

&quot;I think that&#x27;s still a very open question in the US. I think it&#x27;s a question we have to take very seriously.&quot;

On the way loans were being made by private credit, Mr Bailey said there was starting to be &quot;what used to be called sort of slicing and dicing and tranching of loan structures&quot;.

Reflecting on the tone of the conversation prior to the 2008 financial crisis, he said that back then there had been a belief that sub-prime mortgages were &quot;too small to be systematic&quot; but that this had been &quot;the wrong call&quot;.

Last week, Jamie Dimon, the boss of US banking giant JPMorgan Chase, warned the failure of the two US firms could be a sign of more to come.

&quot;My antenna goes up when things like that happen,&quot; he told analysts. &quot;I probably shouldn&#x27;t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.&quot;

Also appearing before the House of Lords&#x27; financial services regulation committee, Sarah Breeden, the Bank&#x27;s deputy governor for financial stability, said the Bank would be examining the private finance sector.

&quot;We can see the vulnerabilities here,&quot; she said. &quot;We can see parallels with the global financial crisis.&quot;</div>

<div class="content">The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair&#x27;s tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.

Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears&#x27;s allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.

Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.

He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.

When they were teenagers, the couple&#x27;s sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. &quot;They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - &#x27;Oh, you&#x27;re awake?&#x27; - with a knife in her hand,&quot; he writes. &quot;Then she&#x27;d turn around and pad off without explanation.&quot;

Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: &quot;The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it&#x27;s racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we&#x27;re getting close to the 11th hour.&quot;

He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears&#x27;s life were controlled by others for years, and described it as a &quot;lifeline&quot; in its early days.

He claims Spears saw the events in her life &quot;through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one&quot;, but that she &quot;needed help&quot; and was &quot;in no state to responsibly manage her own affairs&quot;.

Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could &quot;never fully get behind it&quot;.

The pair got together in the summer of 2004, as Spears&#x27;s initial commercial peak started to wane.

They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.

Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.

The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.

In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.

She made headlines with incidents like shaving her head and hitting a photographer&#x27;s car with an umbrella.</div>

<div class="content">American actor and playwright Colman Domingo has been cast as the Cowardly Lion in the upcoming Wicked: For Good film, putting to rest a weekend of internet speculation on who would play the role.

Jon M Chu, the director for the highly-anticipated sequel film adaptation for the hit Broadway musical, teased the news on Thursday by saying a major Hollywood star will voice the part.

Domingo joins an already star-studded cast that includes Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba.

The film also stars Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum.

Chu told entertainment news outlet Deadline that he approached Domingo for the role of the Cowardly Lion on Instagram.

&quot;I was like, &#x27;It&#x27;s not a ton of lines, but maybe you have a little time. I know you&#x27;re busy. I&#x27;ll come to you,&#x27;&quot; Chu said, according to Deadline. Domingo responded &quot;Why the f--- not. Let&#x27;s go,&quot; he recalled.

The Broadway superstar has been nominated twice for an Academy Award, and has won a Primetime Emmy Award. He was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2024 by Time Magazine.

Buzz has been growing around the sequel Wicked: For Good since the first film was released in November 2024. The first full-length trailer for the sequel was unveiled in June.

Elphaba is now an enemy of the state of Oz, while Glinda has become a public figure controlled by the Wizard, who is played by Goldblum.

The film&#x27;s trailer also teases the arrival of Dorothy - seen walking down the yellow brick road with her friends - suggesting the character might have a bigger role in the films than in the musical. It&#x27;s still unclear who might be cast to play the character.

The films have been adapted from the hugely successful Broadway and West End musical, which itself was based on Gregory Maguire&#x27;s 1995 novel.

The two movies were shot simultaneously at Sky Studios Elstree in the United Kingdon between December 2022 and January 2024, with production interrupted mid-way through by the Hollywood actors&#x27; strike.

Wicked was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations - winning two for best costume and production design.

The sequel movie is set to be released almost a year-to-the-date of its predecessor on 21 November.

Sabrina Carpenter was also among the award winners and performers on the night in New York.</div>

<div class="content">Donald Trump has said he did not want a &quot;wasted meeting&quot; after a plan to have face-to-face talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about the war in Ukraine were put on hold.

The US president indicated that a key sticking point remained Moscow&#x27;s refusal to cease fighting along the current front line, in remarks at the White House on Tuesday.

Key differences between US and Russian proposals for peace became increasingly clear this week, appearing to have dashed chances of a summit.

Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August, during a hastily organised summit which yielded no concrete results.

The White House decision to shelve plans for a second Trump-Putin meeting may be seen as an attempt to avoid another similar scenario.

&quot;I guess the Russians wanted too much and it became evident for the Americans that there will be no deal for Trump in Budapest,&quot; a senior European diplomat told Reuters.

A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was due to be held this week - but the White House said the two had had a &quot;productive&quot; call and that a meeting was no longer &quot;necessary&quot;.

On Monday, Trump embraced a ceasefire proposal backed by Kyiv and European leaders to freeze the conflict on the current front line.

&quot;Let it be cut the way it is,&quot; he said. &quot;I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.&quot;

Russia has repeatedly pushed back against freezing the current line of contact.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that &quot;the consistency of Russia&#x27;s position doesn&#x27;t change&quot; - referring to Moscow&#x27;s insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.

Moscow was only interested in &quot;long-term, sustainable peace&quot;, Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.

The &quot;root causes of the conflict&quot; needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine - a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.

European leaders released a statement with Zelensky earlier on Tuesday saying that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line and accused Russia of not being &quot;serious&quot; about peace.

Zelensky said discussions about the front line were the &quot;beginning of diplomacy&quot;, which Russia was doing everything to avoid.</div>

<div class="content">Israel has received two bodies that Hamas says are two more deceased hostages who had been held in Gaza.

The Israeli military said two coffins were handed over to troops in the Palestinian territory by the Red Cross, which had earlier received them from Hamas.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the coffins - which were escorted by the military - had crossed into Israel and will be taken to be formally identified in Tel Aviv.

Confirmation of their identies would mean that Hamas has transferred 15 out of 28 deceased Israeli hostages under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal earlier this month. All 20 living hostages were released shortly after the agreement was reached.

Hamas has handed over a Palestinian body in a previous hostage transfers, which it said was accidental due to difficulties locating the bodies.

It also stressed that &quot;Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages&quot;.

There has been outrage in Israel that Hamas has not yet returned all the deceased hostages.

The Palestinian group says it is trying to do this but that it faces difficulty finding bodies under rubble of buildings bombed out by the IDF in Gaza.

Under the ceasefire and hostage release agreement, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians for every Israeli hostage&#x27;s remains.

The first phase of the agreement has also seen an increase of aid into Gaza, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt in fighting - though deadly violence flared up over the weekend as both sides accused one another of breaching the terms of the deal.

The IDF launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.

More than 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.

David Ireland said there is a natural affinity between unionists in Northern Ireland and Israel.

The attacker is seen striking the 55-year-old woman with a large wooden stick during the assault in the West Bank village of Turmus Ayaa.

Haimi, killed by Hamas on 7 October 2023, is the 13th out of 28 deceased hostages returned under a ceasefire.</div>

<div class="content">Sea surface temperatures between July and September were more than 0.25C above the previous high of 2022 - a big increase across an area roughly ten times the size of the Mediterranean.

While climate change is known to make marine heatwaves more likely, scientists are struggling to explain why the north Pacific has been so hot for so long.

But all this extra heat in the so-called &quot;warm blob&quot; may have the opposite effect in the UK, possibly making a colder start to winter more likely, some researchers believe.

&quot;There&#x27;s definitely something unusual going on in the north Pacific,&quot; said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.

Such a jump in temperatures across a region so large is &quot;quite remarkable&quot;, he added.

The region extends from the east coast of Asia to the west coast of North America, the same area used in previous scientific studies.

The figures show that not only has the region been warming quickly over the past couple of decades, but 2025 is markedly higher than recent years too.

That the seas are getting hotter is no surprise. Global warming, caused by humanity&#x27;s emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, has already trebled the number of days of extreme heat in oceans globally, according to research published earlier this year.

But temperatures have been even higher than most climate models - computer simulations taking into account humanity&#x27;s carbon emissions - had predicted.

Natural weather variability is thought to be part of the reason. This summer has seen weaker-than-usual winds, for example. That means more heat from the summer sunshine can stay in the sea surface, rather than being mixed with cooler waters below.

But this can only go so far in explaining the exceptional conditions, according to Dr Hausfather.

&quot;It certainly is not just natural variability,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s something else going on here as well.&quot;

One intriguing idea is that a recent change to shipping fuels might be contributing to the warming. Prior to 2020, dirty engine oil produced large amounts of sulphur dioxide, a gas harmful to human health.

But that sulphur also formed tiny, Sun-reflecting particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols, which helped to keep a lid on rising temperatures.

So removing that cooling effect in shipping hotspots like the north Pacific could be revealing the full impact of human-caused warming.</div>

<div class="content">Scientists say seven skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia were most likely Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago.

The male skeletons, all with various injuries, were found &quot;completely preserved&quot; during excavations in 2011 at the site of the Roman city of Mursa - modern-day Osijek - in Croatia&#x27;s far east, a new research paper says.

Mursa was conquered by the Romans during the first century BC and became a large settlement that was also an important centre for trade and craft.

Now, researchers from several European archaeological institutions have been able to determine not only when the men lived, but also how they may have died.

According to the paper, the men in the grave were aged between 36-50 years old, taller-than-average in height, and were &quot;robust&quot; individuals. Their diets were mainly vegetarian, but some had also indulged in a little meat and seafood.

All showed various healed and un-healed injuries, including those caused by blunt force trauma, and there were puncture wounds on two of their torsos, which the scientists believe were likely caused by arrows or spear tips.

All of the men were suffering from some kind of &quot;pulmonary [affecting the lungs] disease during the final days of their lives&quot;.

DNA analysis has also revealed the men had a mix of ancestry and that none appeared to be from the local area.

The paper noted that the Roman Empire was a particularly violent era and that Mursa was involved in several conflicts.

The researchers believe the men were likely victims of the &#x27;Crisis of the Third Century&#x27;, most probably the battle of Mursa from 260 CE, when there were &quot;numerous battles fought between various claimants to the throne&quot;.

The paper states that the pit the skeletons were found in would have originally been a water-well - several of which have been discovered in the area.

It notes that mass burials and mass graves were &quot;not a customary way of interring the dead in the Roman Empire&quot;, and were mostly used in extreme situations and mass casualty events.

Given the various angles the skeletons now lie, the researchers say they were &quot;most probably thrown in&quot; the well before being covered with soil.

Mursa has been of archaeological importance for years, with various ancient civilisation sites discovered in the area.

In a world where a single point of failure can throw our machines into chaos, everything from sharks to authoritarian governments and old ladies have brought the web to its knees.</div>

<div class="content">British number one Jack Draper says the tennis calendar must be adapted after Holger Rune became the latest high-profile player to have his season ended prematurely.

Danish 22-year-old Rune, set to return to the world&#x27;s top 10 after reaching the semi-finals at the Nordic Open in Stockholm, was forced to retire with injury when leading Frenchman Ugo Humbert by a set.

Rune&#x27;s mother, Aneke, later told Danish newspaper BT that she had been informed by medical staff that her son&#x27;s injury was &quot;very bad&quot;.

She said: &quot;They are completely sure that it is a torn Achilles tendon, so it&#x27;s of course very bad. Holger is completely devastated. They say they can see it with the naked eye.&quot;

Draper wrote on X: &quot;Injuries are going to happenâ¦ we are pushing our bodies to do things they aren&#x27;t supposed to in elite sport.

&quot;We have so many incredible younger guys on the tour right now and I&#x27;m proud to be a part of that.

&quot;However, the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity.&quot;

Rune, nursing a hamstring issue coming into the match, appeared instantly aware of the severity of his injury and was emotional as he received treatment after hobbling to his chair.

He had pulled up in pain after jumping to hit a ball at the back of the court, with the game level at 40-40 on Humbert&#x27;s serve and Rune leading 6-4 2-2.

Humbert said: &quot;It was not the way I wanted to win. I&#x27;m super disappointed for Holger, I hope he is going to be OK.

&quot;I wish him a speedy recovery. It was a great match, he was playing a little bit better than me, but I&#x27;m really sorry for Holger.&quot;

Later on Saturday, Novak Djokovic also retired after losing the first set of his third-place play-off against Taylor Fritz at the Six Kings Slam in Saudi Arabia - an exhibition event - having struggled with injury and sickness at last week&#x27;s Shanghai Masters.

Carlos Alcaraz, who finished runner-up to Jannik Sinner at the Saudi Arabia event which is not part of the ATP Tour, criticised the congested tennis calendar in September, saying &quot;they are going to kill us in some way&quot;.

Naomi Osaka became the latest high-profile player to withdraw from a tournament because of injury when she pulled out of the Japan Open with a leg problem before her quarter-final on Friday.

Former women&#x27;s world number one Iga Swiatek complained in September that the season is &quot;too long and too intense&quot; amid a string of injuries among players at the China Open.</div>

WASHINGTON (AP) - Construction started this week on the $250 million ballroom that President Donald Trump is adding to the White House as construction crews began tearing down the facade of the East Wing, where the new space is being built.

PHOTOS: White House starts East Wing demolition to build Trump&#x27;s ballroom

The 90,000-square-foot ballroom will dwarf the main White House itself, at nearly double the size, and Trump says it will accommodate 999 people.

Trump said on social media that the ballroom won&#x27;t cost taxpayers a dime because it is being privately funded by &quot;many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly.&quot;

Here are some things to know about the newest White House construction project.

Trump says the White House needs a large entertaining space and has complained that the East Room, the current largest space in the White House, is too small, holding about 200 people. He has frowned on the past practice of presidents hosting state dinners and other large events in tents on the South Lawn.

Trump says the project will be paid for with private donations and that no public money will be spent on the ballroom. The White House promised to release information on which individuals and corporations have pledged or donated money and invited some of the donors to an East Room dinner last week, but has not released a comprehensive list and breakdown of funds.

Some $22 million for the project came from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, as part of a recent settlement for a 2021 lawsuit Trump brought against the company.

The White House also has not said how much of his own money Trump is contributing.

The East Wing is traditionally the social side of the White House and sits across East Executive Avenue from the Treasury Department. It&#x27;s where tourists and other guests enter for events.

The president and his chief spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said over the summer that the White House itself would remain intact as the ballroom was going up.

&quot;It&#x27;ll be near it but not touching it,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Nothing will be torn down,&quot; Leavitt added.

That turned out not to be the case.</div>

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is expected to leave for Asia at the end of the week, betting that an around-the-world journey will help him untangle big issues that he can&#x27;t afford to get wrong.

At stake is nothing less than the future of the global economy, which could hinge on whether he&#x27;s able to calm trade tensions during an expected meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. A misstep could send shock waves through American industries that have already been rattled by Trump&#x27;s aggressive tariffs, government layoffs and political brinkmanship.

Trump&#x27;s strategy of improvisation has had both hits and misses since he returned to office in January. Hamas returned hostages to Israel but the ceasefire in the Middle East remains fragile; a trade war with China has ebbed and flowed this year; and Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine hasn&#x27;t slowed down despite Trump&#x27;s efforts to resolve the conflict.

There&#x27;s been some mystery around Trump&#x27;s trip, with no official announcements from the White House about much of his itinerary. The president said Monday that he plans to go to Malaysia, which is hosting a regional summit, then Japan, where he&#x27;s trying to nail down foreign investment.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.

He&#x27;ll also visit South Korea, where he&#x27;s working on more trade issues and expects to sit down with Xi. Beijing has yet to confirm that they&#x27;ll meet, and the two leaders have recently exchanged threats of tariffs and export restrictions.

&quot;I have a very good relationship with President Xi of China,&quot; Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. He offered to lower tariffs but &quot;they have to give us some things too,&quot; including buying U.S. soybeans, reducing the flow of fentanyl ingredients and ending limits on rare earth minerals that are critical for high-tech manufacturing.

Trump expressed even more confidence on Monday, saying, &quot;I think we&#x27;re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s going to be fantastic for the entire world.&quot;

With just days to go before Trump leaves, there&#x27;s an unusual level of ambiguity even for a president who loves to keep people guessing about his next move.

&quot;The whole trip has seemed so uncertain from the beginning,&quot; said Bonnie Glaser, a managing director at the German Marshall Fund, a Washington-based think tank.

Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the president, responded to a list of questions about Trump&#x27;s plans by saying he &quot;will participate in meetings and events in Asia that will result in many great deals for our country.&quot; She added, &quot;Stay tuned!&quot;

Trump&#x27;s approach to Asia has focused on using tariffs to realign what he describes as unfair trade practices, unnerving countries that depend on the United States as the world&#x27;s largest market for exports. There&#x27;s also anxiety about Trump&#x27;s meeting with Xi, and the potential that a feud between the two leaders could send the international economy into a tailspin.

&quot;There will be some appreciation for the fact that he&#x27;s there, but I don&#x27;t think it will go far enough to quell the doubts that are pervasive in the region,&quot; Glaser predicted.

The Republican president has downsized his foreign policy team since his first term, eschewing the typical array of advisers at the National Security Council in favor of a core group of loyalists.</div>

<div class="content">Protecting your brain&#x27;s energy and keeping your mind sharp might start with what&#x27;s on your plate. Foods such as fish and seafood, meat, non-starchy vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, eggs, and even full-fat dairy may play a key role in maintaining cognitive health.

Exploring the Power of the Ketogenic Diet

At the University of Missouri, researchers are exploring how these foods influence brain function. Their work focuses on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan known as the ketogenic diet. Early results suggest that this approach could not only support long-term brain health but also slow or even prevent cognitive decline, especially among individuals who face a higher genetic risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Inside the Roy Blunt NextGen Precision Health building, Ai-Ling Lin, a professor in the School of Medicine, and doctoral student Kira Ivanich are examining how the ketogenic diet may benefit people with the APOE4 gene, which is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

In their recent study using mice, Lin and Ivanich found that females with the APOE4 gene developed healthier gut bacteria and showed higher brain energy levels when following a ketogenic diet compared to those on a high-carbohydrate diet. Males did not show the same improvement, suggesting that gender may influence who benefits most from this dietary approach.

The key lies in how the brain produces its energy.

&quot;When we eat carbs, our brains convert the glucose into fuel for our brains, but those with the APOE4 gene -- particularly females -- struggle to convert the glucose into brain energy, and this can lead to cognitive decline down the road,&quot; Ivanich said. &quot;By switching to a keto diet, ketones are produced and used as an alternative fuel source. This may decrease the chance of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s by preserving the health of brain cells.&quot;

These findings highlight the potential of &quot;precision nutrition,&quot; an approach that adapts diets and interventions to fit a person&#x27;s unique biology.

&quot;Instead of expecting one solution to work for everyone, it might be better to consider a variety of factors, including someone&#x27;s genotype, gut microbiome, gender and age,&quot; Lin said. &quot;Since the symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s -- which tend to be irreversible once they start -- usually appear after age 65, the time to be thinking about preserving brain health is well before then, so hopefully our research can offer hope to many people through early interventions.&quot;

Advancing Research Through Collaboration

Lin joined Mizzou in part for its collaborative environment and advanced imaging facilities located in the NextGen Precision Health building and at the University of Missouri Research Reactor.

&quot;We can do a lot of things in-house here that at other places we would have to outsource,&quot; Lin said. &quot;This is team science. The impact we make will be much better when we work together than by ourselves.&quot;

With cutting-edge imaging equipment and both research and clinical spaces under the same roof, the NextGen Precision Health building allows Mizzou to move quickly from preclinical models to human trials.

For Ivanich, that real-world impact is personal.

&quot;When my grandmother got Alzheimer&#x27;s, that sparked my interest in this topic, so being able to make an impact to help people preserve their brain health is very rewarding,&quot; she said. &quot;With Mizzou being a leading research university and having a tight-knit community feel, I know I&#x27;m at the right place.&quot;</div>

<div class="content">It may sound unbelievable, but crystals made of rotating particles are real. A group of physicists from Aachen, Düsseldorf, Mainz, and Wayne State University (Detroit, USA) has explored these unusual materials and their remarkable behavior. These crystals can easily split into separate fragments, form unusual grain boundaries, and display controllable structural defects. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the researchers present a broad theoretical framework that can predict several new properties of these so-called &quot;transverse interaction&quot; systems.

Rotating Systems in Nature and Technology

&quot;Transverse forces&quot; can appear not only in engineered materials, such as certain magnetic solids, but also in biological systems. In an experiment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), researchers observed that groups of starfish embryos, through their swimming motions, influenced each other&#x27;s movement in a way that caused them to rotate around one another. The biological function of this coordinated motion remains unclear, but it shares the same fundamental feature found in these synthetic systems: interacting, rotating objects.

Professor Dr. Hartmut Löwen from the Institute of Theoretical Physics II at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (HHU) explains: &quot;A system of many rotating constituent elements exhibits a qualitatively new behavior that is non-intuitive: At high concentrations, these objects form a solid body of rotors, which possess &#x27;odd&#x27; material properties.&quot;

One such property is known as &quot;odd elasticity.&quot; Normally, when a material is pulled, it stretches along the direction of the force. In contrast, an odd elastic material does not stretch -- it twists instead.

Twisting, Breaking, and Reforming

This kind of &quot;odd&quot; solid can even disintegrate on its own. When the rotating building blocks rub together strongly enough, the solid can fragment into many smaller spinning crystallites. Even more surprisingly, these fragments can later reassemble themselves into a coherent structure once again.

A research team led by Professor Dr. Zhi-Feng Huang from Wayne State University and Professor Löwen developed a multiscale theoretical model to describe the behavior of these odd crystals. Using this model, they performed simulations that revealed unexpected patterns and possible technological uses for these rotating materials.

Reversing the Rules of Crystal Growth

The team found that large crystals governed by transverse interactions tend to break down into smaller spinning units, while smaller crystals grow until reaching a specific critical size. This outcome runs counter to conventional crystal growth, where materials typically expand steadily under favorable conditions.

Professor Huang explains:&quot;We have discovered a fundamental property of nature underlying this process which determines the relation between the size of the critical fragments and their rotation speed.&quot;

Study co-author Professor Dr. Raphael Wittkowski of the DWI -- Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials and of RWTH Aachen University, adds: &quot;We furthermore demonstrated how defects in the crystals exhibit dynamics of their own. The formation of such defects can be influenced from outside, which allows properties of the crystals to be specifically controlled with a view to usage applications.&quot;

&quot;Our far-reaching theory encompasses all systems evidencing such transverse interactions. Conceivable applications range from colloid research to biology,&quot; declares co-author Dr. Michael te Vrugt, Assistant Professor at the University of Mainz.

Professor Löwen adds: &quot;The model calculations indicate concrete application potential. The novel elastic properties of these new crystals could be exploited to invent new technical switching elements, for example.&quot;

In physics, interactions such as gravity and the Coulomb force are known as central forces because they act along the line connecting the centers of two bodies. These forces cause objects to move toward or away from each other.</div>

<div class="content">Scientists at The University of Western Australia&#x27;s node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) have made a remarkable discovery: a massive structure stretching about 185,000 light-years between two galaxies, NGC 4532 and DDO 137, located some 53 million light-years from Earth.

Lead researcher Professor Lister Staveley-Smith from ICRAR UWA explained that the finding provides an important new insight into how galaxies influence each other.

&quot;Our modeling showed that the tidal forces acting between these galaxies, alongside their proximity to the massive Virgo cluster of galaxies, played a crucial role in the gas dynamics we observed,&quot; Professor Staveley-Smith said.

He added that as the galaxies orbited one another and moved toward the superheated gas cloud surrounding the Virgo cluster, which reaches temperatures about 200 times hotter than the Sun&#x27;s surface, they experienced &quot;ram pressure.&quot; This effect stripped gas from the galaxies and heated it as they passed through the dense environment.

&quot;The process is akin to atmospheric burn-up when a satellite re-enters the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere, but has extended over a period of a billion years,&quot; he said.

&quot;The density of electrons and the speed at which galaxies are falling into the hot gas cloud are enough to explain why so much gas has been pulled away from the galaxies and into the bridge and surrounding areas.&quot;

The discovery was made as part of the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Survey (WALLABY), a large-scale project that maps hydrogen gas throughout the Universe using the ASKAP radio telescope, owned and operated by CSIRO, Australia&#x27;s national science agency.

Co-author Professor Kenji Bekki of ICRAR UWA said the team identified the enormous gas structures through high-resolution observations of neutral hydrogen, a key ingredient in star formation.

&quot;Neutral hydrogen plays a crucial role in the formation of stars, making this finding fundamental to understanding how galaxies interact and evolve, particularly in dense environments,&quot; Professor Bekki said.

Professor Staveley-Smith said the system had strong similarities with our own Milky Way and Magellanic System, providing a unique opportunity to study such interactions in detail.

&quot;Understanding these gas bridges and their dynamics provides critical insights into how galaxies evolve over time, how galactic gas is redistributed, and the varying conditions under which galaxies may or may not form stars,&quot; he said.

&quot;This contributes to our broader understanding of the most massive structures in the Universe and their life cycles, which helps us grasp more about their vast complexities and history of star formation.&quot;

What scientists found inside Mars’ frozen vortex</div>

<div class="content">Scientists have recently captured a rare look at the harsh winter conditions swirling above Mars&#x27; north pole. Inside the planet&#x27;s polar vortex, temperatures drop dramatically -- much colder than the air outside -- and the continuous darkness of the long Martian winter allows ozone levels in the atmosphere to rise sharply.

&quot;The atmosphere inside the polar vortex, from near the surface to about 30 kilometers high, is characterized by extreme cold temperatures, about 40 degrees Celsius colder than outside the vortex,&quot; said Dr. Kevin Olsen of the University of Oxford, who presented the results at the EPSC-DPS2025 Joint Meeting in Helsinki.

At these extreme lows, the small amount of water vapor in Mars&#x27; atmosphere freezes and settles onto the polar ice cap. This change has a striking effect on ozone levels. Normally, ozone is destroyed when it reacts with molecules formed as ultraviolet sunlight breaks apart water vapor. But when the vapor freezes out completely, those reactions stop. With nothing left to break it down, ozone begins to build up inside the vortex.

&quot;Ozone is a very important gas on Mars -- it&#x27;s a very reactive form of oxygen and tells us how fast chemistry is happening in the atmosphere,&quot; said Olsen. &quot;By understanding how much ozone there is and how variable it is, we know more about how the atmosphere changed over time, and even whether Mars once had a protective ozone layer like on Earth.&quot;

The European Space Agency&#x27;s ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover, scheduled to launch in 2028, will search for traces of ancient life on the planet. If Mars once had an ozone layer shielding its surface from ultraviolet radiation, that protective barrier could have made it far more hospitable to life billions of years ago.

Mars&#x27; polar vortex develops as part of its seasonal cycle, driven by the planet&#x27;s 25.2-degree axial tilt. Like Earth, the Red Planet experiences seasonal shifts, and as northern summer ends, a swirling vortex forms above the pole and lingers until spring.

On Earth, the polar vortex can sometimes destabilize and drift south, sending cold air into lower latitudes. A similar process can occur on Mars, giving researchers valuable chances to study the vortex&#x27;s interior.

&quot;Because winters at Mars&#x27; north pole experience total darkness, like on Earth, they are very hard to study,&quot; says Olsen. &quot;By being able to measure the vortex and determine whether our observations are inside or outside of the dark vortex, we can really tell what is going on.&quot;

Olsen works with ESA&#x27;s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter that is in orbit around Mars. In particular, the spacecraft&#x27;s Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS) studies Mars&#x27; atmosphere by gazing at the Red Planet&#x27;s limb when the Sun is on the other side of the planet and is shining through the atmosphere. The wavelengths at which the sunlight is absorbed give away which molecules are present in the atmosphere and how high above the surface they are.

However, this technique doesn&#x27;t work during the total darkness of martian winter when the Sun doesn&#x27;t rise over the north pole. The only opportunities to glimpse inside the vortex are when it loses its circular shape but, to know exactly when and where this is happening, requires additional data.

For this, Olsen turned to the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on NASA&#x27;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to measure the extent of the vortex via temperature measurements.

&quot;We looked for a sudden drop in temperature -- a sure sign of being inside the vortex,&quot; said Olsen. &quot;Comparing the ACS observations with the results from the Mars Climate Sounder shows clear differences in the atmosphere inside the vortex compared to outside. This is a fascinating opportunity to learn more about martian atmosphere chemistry and how conditions change during the polar night to allow ozone to build up.&quot;

<div class="content">With great power comes great heat and energy demands

Apple recently announced its new M5 chip, along with the first products powered by the hardware - a 14-inch MacBook Pro, a new iPad Pro and an upgraded Apple Vision Pro.

The M5 includes a next-gen GPU with Neural Accelerators in each of its ten cores, allowing AI computations to run directly on the graphics hardware.

The M5 GPU can deliver over four times the peak compute performance for AI compared with the M4, while improving general graphics performance by about 45 percent.

The CPU, with up to ten cores divided between four performance and six efficiency cores, delivers around 15% faster multithreaded performance (there are actually two M5&#x27;s - the 256GB and 512GB iPad Pro models use a nine-core CPU with three performance cores).

Built on third-generation 3nm technology, the M5 maintains Apple&#x27;s unified memory structure that lets the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine share the same pool of memory, allowing data to move quickly between subsystems, cutting latency and power waste.

Frameworks such as Core ML and Metal benefit automatically from the added boost, meaning developers can see gains without changing their code.

Apple in-house processors have evolved quickly since the first M1 arrived in November 2020, and the new chip aligns perfectly with the American tech juggernaut&#x27;s current focus, where on-device Apple Intelligence plays an increasing role in tasks like image creation, LLM inference, and generative tools within apps.

These workloads now rely more heavily on the GPU and Neural Engine, both of which are more deeply integrated in M5.

But as Apple scales its silicon, cramming more cores and accelerators into compact devices such as MacBook Pro and iPad Pro, it faces inevitable thermal and power challenges.

Apple chips are efficient compared with many of its competitors, but each new generation brings smaller margins for cooling and power headroom.

This issue becomes clearer when looking at possible desktop versions of the M5 family.

This article is the first in a five-part series delving deep into Apple&#x27;s M-class processors, from the early M1 through to the newly announced M5 and our projected M5 Ultra. Each piece will explore how Apple&#x27;s silicon has evolved in architecture, performance, and design philosophy, and what those changes might mean for the company&#x27;s future hardware.

I asked Gemini, Google&#x27;s AI system, to model what an M5 Ultra might look like if Apple continued its usual scaling pattern.

According to Gemini&#x27;s estimates, an M5 Ultra could feature a maximum of 24 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores, and 80 GPU cores, along with up to 240 billion transistors and 1100GB/s memory bandwidth.</div>

<div class="content">When the internet breaks, unexpected things can happen

If you have a smartphone or are familiar with the internet, you may have noticed that things weren&#x27;t quite right yesterday - a huge AWS outage took out the hundreds of services that rely on its cloud computing backbone, and suddenly the digital world felt like it was made of jelly.

The impacts were serious and global, affecting over 1,000 businesses according to Downdetector. But what were some of the stranger glitches and unexpected consequences from the biggest Amazon Web Services outage we&#x27;ve seen for years?

To help give us all a little light relief from error messages and DNS-related nightmares, we&#x27;ve rounded up some of the weirder consequences (big and frivolous) from the biggest IT meltdown since Crowdstrike crashed the world&#x27;s business computers in 2024...

One of our favorite phrases from the AWS outage was Slack&#x27;s &#x27;Trouble with huddles&#x27;, which sounds like album by The National but instead described an IT incident that hit the messaging platform&#x27;s audio feature.

As spotted by The Verge, a Slack status update during the AWS blackout said that &quot;we&#x27;re currently investigating an issue where some users remain stuck in a huddle after attempting to leave&quot;.

Being stuck in a huddle usually wouldn&#x27;t be considered an unpleasant experience, but it&#x27;s slightly more serious in the context of Slack - given that it means being trapped in an audio call with a work colleague that you can&#x27;t leave.

Unfortunately, the problem still isn&#x27;t fully fixed, with Slack saying today that it continues to &quot;work toward cleaning up any huddles that are in a bad state&quot;. The AWS outage at least showed that IT language can sometimes be unintentionally poetic.

The offside lines were drawn for the first time this season to rule out Thiago&#x27;s second goal for Brentford ❌There is no Semi-Automated Offside Technology available today due to the AWS outage 👀 pic.twitter.com/7vxv6fZ3CEOctober 20, 2025

Even the Premier League soccer wasn&#x27;t safe from the AWS outage. There was no old-school floodlight failure or ticket fiasco, but the problems did take out the Semi-Automated Offside Technology during Monday night&#x27;s match between West Ham and Brentford.

Unfortunately, as Sky Sports noted above, that meant officials had to get their much-maligned rulers out again to see if Brentford&#x27;s second goal was offside or not. The human assistants decided it was offside, which predictably caused online outrage.

The Semi-Automated Offside Technology is run by a company called Genius Sports, which recently migrated its infrastructure to a typically safe pair of hands called Amazon Web Services. Unfortunately, this week AWS scored the equivalent of a huge own goal.

An outage that hits the Amazon.com homepage is a rarity, but now we know what to expect when it does go down - lots of dog photos.

At the peak of the AWS outage, Amazon&#x27;s own homepage was among the casualties, which left many unable to see their order histories - and thousands were also confronted with the error screen above.

Now, we&#x27;re not usually fans of twee error pages, but we did enjoy this one - Amazon&#x27;s page served up a number of different dog photos, all of which belong to Amazon workers.</div>
