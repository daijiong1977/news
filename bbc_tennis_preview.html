<p>Cameron Norrie made it to the semi-finals of Wimbledon in 2022</p>
<p>Britain&#x27;s Cameron Norrie battled his way to victory over seventh seed Andrey Rublev to progress to the second round of the Erste Bank Open.</p>
<p>World number 35 Norrie won the two-hour match 6-2 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 in Austria.</p>
<p>Norrie, 30, started the match in fine fashion and took the opening set in just 34 minutes before breaking serve to move 2-0 up in the second.</p>
<p>The Briton served for the match at 5-4, but Rublev landed his first break of serve to force a tie-break, which he won to set up a deciding set.</p>
<p>Former world number eight Norrie regrouped to break Rublev&#x27;s serve in the second game to take command of the third set.</p>
<p>Norrie broke once more to book his spot in the next round, where he will face either Australia&#x27;s Alexei Popyrin or Italy&#x27;s Matteo Berrettini.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Sinner to miss Italy&#x27;s Davis Cup title defence</h2>

<p>Jannik Sinner was world number one until losing the US Open final to Carlos Alcaraz in September</p>
<p>Four-time Grand Slam champion Jannik Sinner will not be part of the Italy team aiming to clinch a third consecutive Davis Cup title next month.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old reached all four Grand Slam singles finals in 2025, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and won the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Saudi Arabia on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sinner is scheduled to take part in the ATP Tour Finals in Turin from 9-16 November, but Italy captain Filippo Volandri said the world number two had &quot;not given his availability&quot; to play at the Davis Cup in Bologna from 18-23 November.</p>
<p>World number one Carlos Alcaraz has been named in Spain&#x27;s team.</p>
<p>Sinner dominates Alcaraz at lucrative Six Kings Slam</p>
<p>&#x27;Sport must adapt&#x27;, says Draper after Rune injury</p>
<p>Sinner says he has taken the decision to miss the Davis Cup so he can have extra preparation time for the start of next season, with the Australian Open being the first Grand Slam of the year in January.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t an easy decision, but after Turin, the goal is to get off on the right foot in Australia,&quot; Sinner told Sky Sport Italy. &quot;It may not seem like it, but a week of preparation during that period can make all the difference.</p>
<p>&quot;We won the Davis Cup in 2023 and 2024, and this time we decided this with my team.&quot;</p>
<p>Lorenzo Musetti and Flavio Cobolli, eighth and 22nd in the world respectively, will be the highest-ranked singles players on show for Italy, who face Austria in their quarter-final.</p>
<p>Volandri said: &quot;The Davis Cup is, and will remain, always his home and I am sure that Jannik will soon be part of the team again.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime, I can count on a group ready to fight and give everything for the blue jersey.&quot;</p>
<p>Sinner&#x27;s absence comes after several players voiced concerns about a demanding tennis calendar in recent weeks.</p>
<p>After Holger Rune sustained a season-ending injury at the Nordic Open on Saturday, British number one Jack Draper posted on social media that &quot;the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity&quot;.</p>
<p>Alcaraz said before the Six Kings Slam he feels players are misunderstood when they make such complaints but also play exhibition events - citing a reduced mental and physical toll at exhibitions compared with official ranking tournaments.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Driving test more stressful than Wimbledon - Xu</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/crl2klwrw7ro?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 4192 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_923083931deb.png'></p>
<p>Mimi Xu enjoyed notable wins at tournaments in Birmingham, Ilkley and Nottingham last season</p>
<p>Venue: Wrexham Tennis and Padel Centre Date: 20-26 October</p>
<p>Coverage: Watch live on BBC Sport online and BBC iPlayer</p>
<p>Teenage tennis star Mimi Xu says her driving test was far more stressful than playing Emma Raducanu on her Wimbledon debut.</p>
<p>Wildcard Xu won the hearts of the nation when she became the first Welsh player to enter the All England Club&#x27;s main singles draw in 20 years.</p>
<p>Xu drew British number one Raducanu in her first-round match and played in front of thousands on Court One.</p>
<p>But the 18-year-old from Swansea says her practical driving test was much more of an ordeal.</p>
<p>&quot;Leading up to the moment I passed, I was so tense, there was no way I could have driven back afterwards,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;My mum doesn&#x27;t trust me enough yet to drive on the big roads!&quot;</p>
<p>Wrexham to host north Wales&#x27; biggest tennis event</p>
<p>Xu is one of 12 British hopes in the Wrexham Open, the biggest tennis event to come to Wales in almost 30 years.</p>
<p>Fresh from winning a W35 doubles title in Birmingham and with a career-best singles ranking of 309, Xu is hopeful of having a good run in north Wales.</p>
<p>She has been drawn against the number three seed, Lithuania&#x27;s Justina Mikulskyte.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m feeling confident in my game, I&#x27;m ready to go, ready to compete,&quot; Xu said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is at the level now where they can beat anyone on their day. Now that I&#x27;m 18 I get to play freely, there is always next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m looking forward to carrying on developing my game, believing in myself, believing in my game, believing in all the hard work that I&#x27;ve put in and being confident to put it all out on the court, results will come if I do that.&quot;</p>
<p>Xu has fond memories of playing in Wrexham as a junior, but this will be the first time she has played a major senior tournament on Welsh soil.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m really excited to play in front of a home Welsh crowd, I&#x27;m used to playing in front of a British crowd, but not a Welsh crowd,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;My first time here was 11 years ago, it&#x27;s changed a lot since then, it&#x27;s been revamped and I&#x27;m really looking forward to playing here.&quot;</p>
<p>Xu is one of the main draws at Wrexham thanks to her Wimbledon exploits and she admits it feels a bit different going from an underdog to a contender.</p>
<p>&quot;Both have their pressures, but as Billie Jean King said &#x27;pressure is a privilege&#x27; and being able to have that home support will mean a lot to me, and that&#x27;s what really helped me get through my Court One experience at Wimbledon.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Boulter&#x27;s poor run continues with first-round loss</h2>

<p>Katie Boulter has not made it past the second round at a Grand Slam in 2025</p>
<p>British number three Katie Boulter&#x27;s poor run of form continued with a straight-sets loss to world number 44 Eva Lys in the first round of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Boulter, 29, was beaten 6-2 6-1 in just one hour and 14 minutes by the 23-year-old German.</p>
<p>After coming through two rounds of qualifying, she was the only British player in the main draw after Emma Raducanu withdrew, ending her season early through illness.</p>
<p>This latest defeat caps a disappointing run of form, which has seen the former world number 29 unable to progress beyond the second round of a tournament since the Nottingham Open in June.</p>
<p>It also comes five days after the Briton lost in straight sets in the second round of the Japan Open by world number 51 Sorana Cirstea.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, British number four Fran Jones was beaten in straight sets by China&#x27;s Wang Xiyu in the first round of the Guangzhou Open.</p>
<p>Seventh seed Jones was broken four times in the match as she lost 6-4 6-4 to the world number 163.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Resurgent Medvedev wins first title for 882 days</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c993xele2d3o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 3784 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_8f34283f3a9c.jpg'></p>
<p>Nineteen of Daniil Medvedev&#x27;s 21 titles have been won on hard courts</p>
<p>A resurgent Daniil Medvedev claimed his first title for 882 days with victory over Corentin Moutet in the Almaty Open final.</p>
<p>The Russian former world number one has had a torrid year, winning just one match at the Grand Slams and suffering a meltdown at the US Open.</p>
<p>Medvedev&#x27;s inconsistency on the ATP Tour - and struggles with his serve in particular - led to him dropping out of the world&#x27;s top 10 and ultimately splitting with long-time coach Gilles Cervara.</p>
<p>Now working with Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke, Medvedev has steadily improved in the past month - culminating in a hard-fought 7-5 4-6 6-3 victory over Frenchman Moutet.</p>
<p>It is Medvedev&#x27;s first title since the 2023 Rome Masters and first on a hard court since March of that year.</p>
<p>Victory also means Medvedev has won 21 titles at 21 different tournaments.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m at a tournament with my two daughters together, so to get a title is really nice,&quot; said world number 14 Medvedev.</p>
<p>&quot;This title is in honour of my second daughter, Victoria, because the first title I got when my first daughter Alisa was born was for her.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x27;Sport must adapt&#x27;, says Draper after Rune injury</p>
<p>Osaka out of Japan Open as tennis casualty list grows</p>
<p>Sinner dominates Alcaraz at lucrative Six Kings Slam</p>
<p>Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion, had lost his past six finals, including in Halle earlier this year.</p>
<p>His defensive play style and frequent outbursts on court had led some to wonder if his ability to compete at the top level was over.</p>
<p>But the 29-year-old has made changes in recent weeks, making an effort to come to the net and play aggressively, backed up by an improved serve.</p>
<p>He came back from a break down in the first set against the tricky Moutet, winning four of the final five games to take the lead.</p>
<p>The pair exchanged breaks in the second set before Moutet, bidding for his first ATP Tour title, took control to force a decider.</p>
<p>Fittingly, Medvedev secured victory with a point at the net, with Moutet unable to control a volley after two hours and 38 minutes.</p>

<p>Jannik Sinner claimed a commanding victory over rival Carlos Alcaraz to win the lucrative Six Kings Slam in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Sinner, replaced as world number one by Alcaraz following the US Open in September, exacted revenge for his defeat in the New York final with a 6-2 6-4 win.</p>
<p>While the pair split the four Grand Slam titles between them this season, Sinner was dominant from the outset against Alcaraz, who said his opponent was &quot;just too good&quot; on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sinner broke Alcaraz&#x27;s serve in the opening game and swiftly wrapped up the first set, with the Spaniard unable to gain a foothold against his opponent&#x27;s clinical serving.</p>
<p>He would go on to win the exhibition event for the second consecutive year after making the decisive breakthrough in the seventh game of the second set.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could play like this everywhere,&quot; Sinner said in his on-court interview.</p>
<p>&quot;This season we played many, many times and I also lost many times to Carlos. It is a huge pleasure and honour to share the court with him.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very special friendship and it&#x27;s very nice.&quot;</p>

<p>Rating Raducanu&#x27;s season - and what does future hold?</p>
<p>Six of the world&#x27;s top men&#x27;s players competed at the three-day exhibition event in Saudi Arabia, which was streamed on Netflix.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has been accused of using its investment in sports and high-profile events to improve its image - known as &#x27;sportswashing&#x27; - amid criticism over its human rights record.</p>
<p>Alcaraz beat Taylor Fritz in straight sets to reach the final and Sinner overpowered joint-record 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic, who withdrew from his third-place play-off after losing the first set against Fritz earlier on Saturday.</p>
<p>Together, Sinner and Alcaraz have won nine of the sport&#x27;s past 10 majors and met in each of the last three slam finals in the early years of a burgeoning rivalry which has gripped the sport.</p>
<p>&quot;When Jannik is playing at this level it is always difficult, today he was just too good,&quot; Alcaraz said.</p>

<p>Holger Rune has won five tour-level titles</p>
<p>British number one Jack Draper says the tennis calendar must be adapted after Holger Rune became the latest high-profile player to have his season ended prematurely.</p>
<p>Danish 22-year-old Rune, set to return to the world&#x27;s top 10 after reaching the semi-finals at the Nordic Open in Stockholm, was forced to retire with injury when leading Frenchman Ugo Humbert by a set.</p>
<p>Rune&#x27;s mother, Aneke, later told Danish newspaper BT that she had been informed by medical staff that her son&#x27;s injury was &quot;very bad&quot;.</p>
<p>She said: &quot;They are completely sure that it is a torn Achilles tendon, so it&#x27;s of course very bad. Holger is completely devastated. They say they can see it with the naked eye.&quot;</p>
<p>Draper wrote on X: &quot;Injuries are going to happenâ¦ we are pushing our bodies to do things they aren&#x27;t supposed to in elite sport.</p>
<p>&quot;We have so many incredible younger guys on the tour right now and I&#x27;m proud to be a part of that.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity.&quot;</p>
<p>Rune, nursing a hamstring issue coming into the match, appeared instantly aware of the severity of his injury and was emotional as he received treatment after hobbling to his chair.</p>
<p>He had pulled up in pain after jumping to hit a ball at the back of the court, with the game level at 40-40 on Humbert&#x27;s serve and Rune leading 6-4 2-2.</p>
<p>Humbert said: &quot;It was not the way I wanted to win. I&#x27;m super disappointed for Holger, I hope he is going to be OK.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish him a speedy recovery. It was a great match, he was playing a little bit better than me, but I&#x27;m really sorry for Holger.&quot;</p>
<p>Later on Saturday, Novak Djokovic also retired after losing the first set of his third-place play-off against Taylor Fritz at the Six Kings Slam in Saudi Arabia - an exhibition event - having struggled with injury and sickness at last week&#x27;s Shanghai Masters.</p>
<p>Carlos Alcaraz, who finished runner-up to Jannik Sinner at the Saudi Arabia event which is not part of the ATP Tour, criticised the congested tennis calendar in September, saying &quot;they are going to kill us in some way&quot;.</p>
<p>Naomi Osaka became the latest high-profile player to withdraw from a tournament because of injury when she pulled out of the Japan Open with a leg problem before her quarter-final on Friday.</p>
<p>Former women&#x27;s world number one Iga Swiatek complained in September that the season is &quot;too long and too intense&quot; amid a string of injuries among players at the China Open.</p>
<p>British number one Emma Raducanu called time on her season on Thursday after she was forced to retire from her two previous matches with illness.</p>
<p>Australia&#x27;s Daria Kasatkina, Ukraine&#x27;s Elina Svitolina and Spain&#x27;s Paula Badosa also ended their seasons earlier than planned in recent weeks, citing either injury or a need to take a break from the tour.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Osaka out of Japan Open as tennis casualty list grows</h2>

<p>Naomi Osaka&#x27;s last Grand Slam trophy came at the Australian Open in 2021</p>
<p>Naomi Osaka has pulled out of the Japan Open before Friday&#x27;s quarter-final because of a leg injury sustained in the second round.</p>
<p>The former world number one held back tears and needed painkillers to come through a three-set last-16 win over defending champion Suzan Lamens on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Top seed Osaka, who completed the match with strapping on her left thigh, was due to face Jaqueline Cristian in the last eight but the Romanian will instead progress to the semi-finals.</p>
<p>The Japan Open made the announcement on X, saying: &quot;We regret to announce that Naomi Osaka has not recovered from a left leg injury sustained during the second round of this tournament and has withdrawn from the quarter-finals scheduled for today.&quot;</p>
<p>It is not yet known whether Osaka will play in the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo later this month.</p>
<p>The four-time Grand Slam champion is the latest high-profile player to suffer late-season injury or health issues.</p>
<p>In September, Iga Swiatek complained the season is &quot;too long and too intense&quot; following a string of injuries among players at the China Open.</p>
<p>British number one Emma Raducanu called time on her season on Thursday after retiring from her two previous matches with illness.</p>
<p>Australia&#x27;s Daria Kasatkina, Ukraine&#x27;s Elina Svitolina and Spain&#x27;s Paula Badosa also ended their seasons early in recent weeks, citing either injury or a pressing need to take a break from the tour.</p>
<p>Across two tournaments in China last week, five players retired injured.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Draper &amp; coach Trotman part ways after four years</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cn7emxek67lo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 4683 chars</p>

<p>James Trotman (right) has been an ever-present with Jack Draper over the past four years</p>
<p>Jack Draper will no longer work with the man who coached him to the Indian Wells title as James Trotman wants to prioritise time with his family.</p>
<p>The British number one has already hired Jamie Delgado as his head coach for next season but had been hoping there would also be a role for the man with whom he has enjoyed much success over the past four years.</p>
<p>Trotman says it has become increasingly difficult to &quot;juggle&quot; Draper&#x27;s career with his own family life.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve made the decision that four years has been a great run,&quot; Trotman told BBC Sport.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed it, but it was getting increasingly difficult for me juggling the demands Jack deserves as the player that he is - and also being a father and a husband.</p>
<p>&quot;I need to start to get those energy levels back up and have a little bit more normality - watch my son play football on a Sunday, go on some family holidays, have a bit more of a normal life.&quot;</p>
<p>Trotman says he first spoke to Draper about his future after Wimbledon, having felt mentally and physically tired over the previous year.</p>
<p>The pair have been working together this week, with 23-year-old Draper returning to the practice court after resting the left arm injury that ended his season early.</p>
<p>If the bruising in his arm heals as expected, Trotman will head to San Diego for some warm weather training with Draper and Delgado at the end of November.</p>
<p>But after that, he will return to his job as an LTA men&#x27;s national coach.</p>
<p>&quot;My relationship with Jack is strong. We are extremely close,&quot; Trotman continued.</p>
<p>&quot;We spent more time with each other than anybody else on the planet over the past four years.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to stay incredibly close and obviously I&#x27;ll be following and supporting in any way I can from the sidelines.&quot;</p>
<p>As well as winning the Masters 1000 event in Indian Wells in March, Draper hit a career-high world ranking of four in June.</p>
<p>Last year, he reached the US Open semi-finals and won his first two ATP titles.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever Jack does in the future, I feel incredibly proud of the work that I&#x27;ve done,&quot; Trotman said.</p>
<p>&quot;And where Jack is now, is not just as a result of me, it&#x27;s a result of everybody that&#x27;s worked with Jack and his family from a young age.&quot;</p>
<p>Draper is due to make his comeback at the three-day UTS Grand Final in London in December, and is also expected to play an exhibition in Macau later that month.</p>
<p>As the top-ranked British player, he will then have the opportunity to start next season by representing his country in the United Cup mixed team competition in Sydney and Perth.</p>
<p>Delgado will be in full charge by then, and Trotman speaks highly of a man he has known since he was 12.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the few people we could have worked really well together with was Jamie,&quot; Trotman added.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a huge respect for him as a person and as a coach and the job that he has done with Gilles Muller, Andy [Murray] and more recently with Grigor [Dimitrov].&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>LeBron, Ronaldo, Brady &#x27;inspire&#x27; Djokovic to play into 40s</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/clyzj1grnzeo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 4106 chars</p>

<p>Novak Djokovic turned professional in 2003 but has no intention of retirement yet</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic wants to follow sporting greats such as LeBron James, Cristiano Ronaldo and Tom Brady by playing in his 40s and help shape the future of tennis.</p>
<p>The 24-time Grand Slam champion, 38, reached the semi-finals of all four major tournaments this year.</p>
<p>Djokovic has been chasing one more to move clear of Australian Margaret Court for the most Grand Slam singles titles in history.</p>
<p>However, his last came at the 2023 US Open when he was 36 - the same age his great rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal also won their final majors.</p>
<p>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner won two each this year, with Djokovic losing to world number two Sinner in the last four at Wimbledon and the French Open, and Spaniard Alcaraz at the US Open.</p>
<p>The Serb retired from his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev with injury, having beat Alcaraz in the previous round.</p>
<p>Every tournament exit has led to questions about his future, but Djokovic said he had no plans to retire and took inspiration from stars in other sports who have defied age to play at the top.</p>
<p>Speaking at a conference at Joy Forum in Riyadh, Djokovic said: &quot;Longevity is one of my biggest motivations.</p>
<p>&quot;I really want to see how far I can go. If you see across all the global sports, Lebron James he is still going strong, he is 40, Cristiano Ronaldo, Tom Brady played until he was 40-something years old, it is unbelievable.</p>
<p>&quot;In the next couple of years tennis is a sport that can be greatly transformed and I want to be part of that change.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to be playing when we rejuvenate our sport and set the new platform that is going to go on for decades to come.&quot;</p>
<p>Leading players are pushing the Grand Slams for a greater share of revenue, while the Professional Tennis Players Association - co-founded by Djokovic - launched lawsuits against tennis&#x27; governing bodies earlier this year in an effort to force through changes.</p>
<p>Djokovic was speaking in Saudi Arabia for the Six Kings Slam exhibition tournament, where he and six-time major champion Alcaraz have been given byes to the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Djokovic lost 6-4 6-2 to the event&#x27;s defending champion Sinner on Thursday night.</p>
<p>The Italian, 24, will face rival Alcaraz in the final for a second year in a row after the world number one overcame America&#x27;s Taylor Fritz 6-4 6-2.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Raducanu ends season and will keep coach for 2026</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cjek3pp34ljo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 4042 chars</p>

<p>Emma Raducanu reached the third round of three of the four Grand Slams this year</p>
<p>Britain&#x27;s Emma Raducanu has withdrawn from her final two events of the year because of the illness she has been battling over the past 10 days.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old was due to play in Tokyo and Hong Kong but has decided to fly home to recover before starting her preparations for 2026.</p>
<p>Those preparations will include coach Francisco Roig, as the pair have agreed to work together again next season.</p>
<p>Raducanu had her blood pressure taken during her first-round match with Ann Li in Wuhan last week and retired when trailing 6-1 4-1 on an oppressively humid day.</p>
<p>She again required a visit from the doctor at this week&#x27;s Ningbo Open, where she lost in three sets to Chinese wildcard Zhu Lin in the opening round.</p>
<p>Raducanu was also moving far from freely in the deciding set against Zhu because of the lower back problem that has troubled her at times this year.</p>
<p>Those results meant an encouraging season, in which Raducanu rose into the world&#x27;s top 30 for the first time in more than three years, ended with three successive defeats.</p>
<p>Raducanu had three match points before losing to Jessica Pegula in the third round in Beijing last month.</p>

<p>Raducanu won 28 matches this year and reached the semi-finals in Washington, but her most impressive week was at the Miami Open in March.</p>
<p>The British number one reached the quarter-finals of the WTA 1000 event, beating eighth seed Emma Navarro on the way before losing in three sets to fourth-ranked Pegula.</p>
<p>She was coached by Mark Petchey from Miami until Wimbledon, with Roig taking over in time for the US Open.</p>
<p>The initial agreement with Rafael Nadal&#x27;s former coach was until the end of the season but the partnership will continue, with a training block pencilled in for the end of the year.</p>
<p>Raducanu told BBC Sport her three-day trial with Roig after Wimbledon was like a &quot;black ops mission&quot; as they tried to keep the meeting secret.</p>
<p>She came very close to beating world number one Aryna Sabalenka at their first tournament together in Cincinnati in August.</p>
<p>Roig was also with Raducanu in New York, where she reached the third round before being beaten by 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Players &#x27;misunderstood&#x27; over exhibition criticisms</h2>

<p>Carlos Alcaraz has won eight tournaments this season</p>
<p>World number one Carlos Alcaraz says players are misunderstood when they want to play in exhibition tournaments alongside the demanding tennis calendar.</p>
<p>Alcaraz, 22, was among those critical of the workload in Asia, where some players struggled physically, with the Spaniard saying he would consider skipping mandatory events to prioritise his health.</p>
<p>He is top seed at this week&#x27;s lucrative Six Kings Slam in Saudi Arabia, a six-man tournament from 15 to 18 October that also includes Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz and Stefanos Tsitsipas.</p>
<p>But Alcaraz feels that shorter-format events such as the Six Kings Slam are less gruelling than tour competitions, and therefore make fewer demands on the players.</p>
<p>He said: &quot;A lot of players are talking about the calendar, how tight it is with a lot of tournaments, tournaments of two weeks, and then making excuses with exhibitions.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re just having fun for one or two days and playing some tennis, and that&#x27;s great, and why we choose the exhibitions.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand [the criticism], but sometimes people don&#x27;t understand us, our opinions. It&#x27;s not really demanding mentally [compared with] when we&#x27;re having such long events like two weeks or two and a half weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>Alcaraz won his eighth title of the season in Tokyo last month despite an ankle injury sustained in his opening match that prompted him to pull out of the Shanghai Masters.</p>
<p>He will play in Saudi Arabia despite the injury not being fully healed. &quot;Everything&#x27;s OK,&quot; said Alcaraz. &quot;I&#x27;ve been recovering the ankle as much as I can.</p>
<p>Alcaraz has a bye to the semi-finals of the event, which will be broadcast on Netflix, where he will face Fritz on Thursday after the American gained a 6-3 6-4 victory over Zverev.</p>
<p>In Wednesday&#x27;s other quarter-final, world number two Sinner beat Tsitsipas 6-2 6-3 and will face Djokovic in the semi-finals.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>&#x27;One family that won&#x27; - Vacherot beats cousin for historic Shanghai title</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cx2x2d749qwo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 4948 chars</p>

<p>Valentin Vacherot had won just one match on the ATP Tour before the Shanghai Masters</p>
<p>World number 204 Valentin Vacherot upset his cousin Arthur Rinderknech to win his first ATP title at the Shanghai Masters.</p>
<p>Monaco&#x27;s Vacherot fought back from a set down to win 4-6 6-3 6-3 against the world number 54 to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1,000 champion since the series began in 1990.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old earns prize money of Â£824,000 - more than double Vacherot&#x27;s previous career earnings of Â£380,000.</p>
<p>Vacherot then continued the winner&#x27;s tradition of writing a message on one of the courtside cameras, writing &quot;Grandpa and Grandma would be proud&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unreal what just happened - I have no idea what is happening right now. I am not even dreaming, it is just crazy,&quot; said Vacherot.</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be one loser but I think there are two winners today. One family that won and I think for the sport of tennis, the story is unreal.&quot;</p>
<p>Frenchman Rinderknech added: &quot;Valentin, you gave everything. I am so happy for you. Two cousins are stronger than one.&quot;</p>
<p>More Than The Score: Vacherot on unreal feeling of beating his cousin to make tennis history</p>
<p>Both players struggled to hold back tears during the post-match ceremony</p>
<p>The story behind Vacherot&#x27;s emergence from relative obscurity is remarkable:</p>
<p>It was the first men&#x27;s tour singles final between family members since John McEnroe beat brother Patrick at the Chicago Open in 1991</p>
<p>Vacherot was not on the original qualifying list so only entered after two players withdrew</p>
<p>He fought back from a set down to win in six of his nine matches</p>
<p>The 26-year-old had won just one match on the main ATP Tour before this tournament, having mainly competed on the lower-level Challenger Tour</p>
<p>He is the first player from Monaco to win a tour-level title in the Open era, which began in 1968</p>
<p>His run to the final included wins over world number 11 Holger Rune and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic</p>
<p>Victory means Vacherot will break into the ATP top 100 for the first time, while Rinderknech - whose career-high ranking is 42 - will move into the top 40</p>
<p>The pair had played against each other at junior level and in college at Texas A&amp;M University, but never at professional level.</p>
<p>Rinderknech, 30, converted his first break point of the match in the third game as his opponent made a nervy start.</p>
<p>With 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer watching in the stands, Vacherot regained his composure as the rest of the set went with serve.</p>
<p>The second set was similarly close before a superb backhand down the line gave Vacherot a crucial break to go 5-3 up, before holding to set up a decider.</p>
<p>There was a short break between the second and third sets to allow the players to change their shirts, which were drenched in sweat due to the hot and humid conditions.</p>
<p>That stoppage failed to halt Vacherot&#x27;s momentum as he converted the third of three break points with a stunning cross-court backhand in the first game of the final set.</p>
<p>Rinderknech dug in to stay in the match, saving nine of 10 break points in his first three service games, before needing a medical timeout to have treatment on his back.</p>
<p>He was able to resume but looked to be running on empty as Vacherot closed out the match for a famous victory.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Boulter out of Japan Open in second round</h2>

<p>Katie Boulter has a career-high ranking of 23</p>
<p>British number three Katie Boulter was beaten 6-3 6-1 by Romania&#x27;s Sorana Cirstea in the second round of the Japan Open.</p>
<p>World number 59 Boulter, who shocked world number 17 Linda Noskova in the first round, lost in one hour nine minutes in Osaka.</p>
<p>There were three breaks of serve in the opening four games as Cirstea, ranked 51 in the world, went 3-1 ahead before wrapping up the first set.</p>
<p>She broke Boulter three times on the way to a 5-0 lead in the second.</p>
<p>Although Boulter broke back, she failed to hold serve in the next game as the impressive Cirstea secured a quarter-final place.</p>
<p>Japan&#x27;s Naomi Osaka had a medical timeout in her 7-6 (8-6) 3-6 6-2 win over defending champion Suzan Lamens of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Osaka was 5-0 up in the final set when she was treated, returning with strapping around her left thigh before securing a quarter-final meeting with Romania&#x27;s Jaqueline Cristian on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was definitely really difficult,&quot; said Osaka. &quot;I&#x27;m kind of sorry for my attitude but I&#x27;m really glad to have won.&quot;</p>
<p>She ended the on-court interview by saying: &quot;Can I go? My leg is really hurting.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Raducanu has blood pressure taken in China defeat</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cn51r5xpl2go?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 4001 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_077d4b8c5f9c.jpg'></p>
<p>Emma Raducanu is the British women&#x27;s number one in singles</p>
<p>Britain&#x27;s Emma Raducanu struggled physically in a three-set loss to world number 219 Zhu Lin in the first round of the Ningbo Open in China.</p>
<p>Raducanu, 22, faded badly against the Chinese wildcard, losing 3-6 6-4 6-1 in two hours 26 minutes.</p>
<p>She had her blood pressure and vital signs taken during the second set and was given something to eat and drink by the physio.</p>
<p>She also had a medical timeout in the third set for treatment on her back, with her movement and service motion visibly hindered from then on.</p>
<p>World number 29 Raducanu retired with illness from the first round of the Wuhan Open last week.</p>
<p>Raducanu has two tournaments - the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo and the Hong Kong Open - left on her schedule this year.</p>
<p>Francis Roig, who has an agreement to coach Raducanu until the end of the season, is not with her in Ningbo.</p>
<p>Raducanu has played 50 matches on the WTA Tour this year, the most since her breakthrough US Open triumph in 2021.</p>
<p>The physical demands may be starting to show, with Raducanu&#x27;s movement falling away as former top-40 player Zhu extended the rallies to keep her on court for longer.</p>
<p>She raced into a 3-0 lead and served out the opening set despite four breaks of serve in the final five games.</p>
<p>She and Zhu exchanged breaks early in the second set before Raducanu asked for the physio. She left the court after Zhu forced a decider.</p>
<p>Raducanu grabbed at her back early in the third set after running for a forehand, and she made more errors as the match went on.</p>
<p>Zhu faces Russian top seed Mirra Andreeva in the last 16 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The season is not ending as Raducanu had envisaged.</p>
<p>In Ningbo it appeared she had not fully recovered from last week&#x27;s illness, and her lower back problem, which flares up from time to time, hindered her mobility.</p>
<p>It is only two weeks since she had three match points to beat world number five Jessica Pegula in Beijing. But since that deciding set, life has been a struggle.</p>
<p>Ningbo was Raducanu&#x27;s 22nd tournament of the year, which represents a very full schedule.</p>
<p>She is still to play in Tokyo and Hong Kong, so could be out on tour until early November, unless she decides it is time to rest her body and mind and focus on 2026.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Gauff beats Pegula to win Wuhan Open title</h2>

<p>Gauff is the first woman to win nine consecutive hard-court titles since Serena Williams</p>
<p>Coco Gauff became the first player to win her first nine hard court finals as she beat Jessica Pegula in straight sets to win the Wuhan Open.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old world number three won 6-4 7-5 against her American compatriot to claim her 11th career singles title in total.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d like to thank my team, it was a great Asian swing [of tournaments],&quot; Gauff said in her victory speech.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going to call JC [her coach Jean-Christophe Faurel] out here; he originally didn&#x27;t want me to come because I had a tough US Open but I had to prove him wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m a very stubborn person, so maybe he said that on purpose for me to have a good result here.&quot;</p>
<p>The French Open champion, who was making her second appearance at the Wuhan Open, trailed 3-0 in the second set but dug deep to reduce the deficit to 5-3 before claiming four straight games to seal victory.</p>
<p>At 5-4, Pegula had the chance to force a final-set decider on serve but was broken emphatically by a relentless Gauff.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re the three-set queen,&quot; she told Pegula on court, &quot;so I was determined not to let you get there today because I felt like the odds would be in your favour in the third set.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s an honour to play you, as a friend and fellow American in the final,&quot; added a gracious Pegula.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s our first final, so that was a lot of fun being able to play.&quot;</p>

<p>Katie Boulter reached a career-high ranking of 23 in 2024</p>
<p>British number three Katie Boulter moved into the second round of the Japan Open after an impressive win over world number 17 Linda Noskova.</p>
<p>The world number 59 beat her Czech opponent 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 in one hour and 36 minutes in Osaka to set up a second-round tie against Romania&#x27;s Sorana Cirstea.</p>
<p>It was Boulter&#x27;s first victory against a top-20 opponent since beating Paula Badosa at Wimbledon in July.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m really pleased with my performance today. It&#x27;s been a difficult few weeks,&quot; said Boulter.</p>
<p>&quot;I just tried to bet on myself - to commit to the ball and go for it.</p>
<p>&quot;Against someone like that you have to win the match, because they&#x27;re not going to lose it.&quot;</p>
<p>Both players lost their serve three times in the first set but Boulter dominated the tie-break to take an advantage.</p>
<p>The victory was much-needed after a disappointing summer.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old came into the match on the back of five opening-round defeats from seven tournaments, slipping behind Sonay Kartal in the rankings to become Britain&#x27;s number three.</p>
<p>Cirstea came from behind to beat Japan&#x27;s Moyuka Uchijima 2-6 6-4 6-2 to set up the match against Boulter.</p>
<p>Top seed Naomi Osaka strolled into the second round with a comprehensive 6-0 6-4 win against Sonobe Wakana.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Djokovic loses to qualifier as cousins set up Shanghai final</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cz696pywwnlo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 4546 chars</p>

<p>Novak Djokovic (right) will not win a record-extending fifth title in Shanghai this year</p>
<p>An injury-hit Novak Djokovic suffered a shock defeat by qualifier Valentin Vacherot in the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters.</p>
<p>Monaco&#x27;s Vacherot, ranked 204th in the world, won 6-3 6-4 to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 finalist in history.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old will face his cousin, unseeded Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, in Sunday&#x27;s final.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m trying to pinch myself - is this real?&quot; said Vacherot, 26.</p>
<p>&quot;To have Novak on the other side of the court was first of all an invaluable experience for me. I have a hundred feelings right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Injury has been a problem all tournament for Djokovic and he vomited during his previous matches after struggling with the heat and humidity.</p>
<p>The issues flared up again in Saturday&#x27;s semi-final with the 38-year-old receiving medical treatment on several occasions.</p>
<p>At the start of the seventh game, the former world number one had to take an extended medical break, lying on his stomach shirtless as a physio attended to his back.</p>
<p>He received treatment again at the break but battled through into the second set.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to congratulate Valentin for reaching his first Masters final,&quot; Djokovic said.</p>
<p>&quot;Going from qualifications, it&#x27;s an amazing story. I told him at the net that he&#x27;s had an amazing tournament, but more so his attitude is very good and his game was amazing as well.</p>
<p>&quot;So it&#x27;s all about him. I wish him all the best in the finals and the better player won today.&quot;</p>
<p>Vacherot, who ensured he would rise into the top 100 for the first time by defeating Holger Rune in the quarter-finals, has now climbed 146 spots to world number 58 in the live rankings as a result of his Shanghai run.</p>
<p>Later on Saturday, Arthur Rinderknech ensured Sunday&#x27;s final would be a family affair by beating Daniil Medvedev in a final-set decider.</p>
<p>Rinderknech came from a set down to beat 2019 Shanghai winner Medvedev and reach his second ATP Tour final.</p>
<p>Trailing 6-4 after the opener, the 30-year-old won the next two sets 6-2 6-4 to complete the turnaround.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t even say it&#x27;s a dream because I don&#x27;t think even one person in our family dreamed about it,&quot; Rinderknech said about facing his cousin in Sunday&#x27;s final.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a dream that came out of nowhere.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t finish a point with Daniil and I was pretty much just dead after a set and I was like, you know what, maybe I&#x27;m going to lose, but I&#x27;m going to fight like crazy, so I&#x27;m going to make him tired for tomorrow and at least I&#x27;m going to help Val to try to start the match a little bit ahead physically, at least.&quot;</p>
<p>Vacherot returned to centre court to watch the end of the second semi-final and embraced his cousin following his victory.</p>
<p>Sunday&#x27;s final in Shanghai gets under way at 09:30 BST.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Players accused of doping offered financial help</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c62lyvrklz4o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 3619 chars</p>

<p>Players involved in doping or corruption investigations will be able to receive financial assistance in a new trial launched by the International Tennis Integrity Agency.</p>
<p>Players accused of doping will be able to use the financial support to test products like supplements in a laboratory, or to identify sources of potential meat contamination.</p>
<p>The package also includes a degree of free legal support and confidential third-party counselling.</p>
<p>The relatively speedy outcome to last year&#x27;s cases involving Grand Slam champions Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek - who served three-month and one-month bans respectively - has been compared to the lengthy legal process faced by Britain&#x27;s Tara Moore, who has been banned for four years.</p>
<p>&quot;The question is whether a player can afford to pay a significant amount of money for a law firm that would then more efficiently represent his or her case,&quot; 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic said at last year&#x27;s US Open.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like we have to collectively investigate how we can standardise everything so that every player, regardless of his ranking or status or profile, is able to get the same kind of treatment.&quot;</p>
<p>This will now be open to players from the moment they test positive, rather than when they are charged, but long-term support is dependent on finding lawyers who are prepared to work for free.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who finds themselves part of either an anti-doping or anti-corruption investigation deserves the opportunity to defend or explain themselves, and we recognise the process can come at both a financial and emotional cost,&quot; ITIA chief executive Karen Moorhouse said.</p>
<p>&quot;No player picks up a tennis racquet as a child with any motivation other than playing the game.</p>
<p>&quot;Individuals find themselves in these situations for a lot of reasons, and so no matter what those reasons are, and where the case ends up, they also deserve someone to talk to.&quot;</p>
<p>The trial will be reviewed at the end of 2026.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Breakwell dreams of Grand Slams after career high</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c80gz1g9l4ro?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 3439 chars</p>

<p>Abbie Breakwell tells of her joy at achieving a career high ranking after a difficult year</p>
<p>It has been a year of debilitating lows and career highs for British wheelchair tennis player Abbie Breakwell.</p>
<p>After recovering from an illness that was so bad she almost lost her sight, the Paralympian has managed to recover to climb to number 28 in the world rankings.</p>
<p>And the 23-year-old did all that while completing her studies at Loughborough University.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though my year was delayed and I couldn&#x27;t properly start it until May, to keep pushing on and going from my ranking dropping to the lowest it&#x27;s ever been to a career high is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that in such a short time I&#x27;ve managed to make such leaps to keep striving forwards really proves how well both me and my team have worked.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x27;I was losing my sight&#x27; - Breakwell on comeback from illness</p>
<p>Breakwell was forced out of action for almost three months after catching Covid-19 in February.</p>
<p>She was hospitalised and even lost her sight for a time because of complications with the neurological condition she lives with, called spinal syrinx.</p>
<p>But after a cluster of wins in the past few months, her world ranking has soared.</p>
<p>Breakwell&#x27;s mother, Sarah, said the year of trials and tribulations come down to her daughter simply &quot;never giving up&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thing is her determination never to stop and just keep driving forward,&quot;  Sarah continued.</p>
<p>The season is now wrapping up for Breakwell, allowing her time to reflect and plan a much-deserved post-season treat.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going to see if I can go on holiday,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#x27;d love to go to Disney in Florida but we&#x27;ll have to see what the bank can afford!&quot;</p>
<p>And as for next year? &quot;I hope that I can get into a Grand Slam, but also I&#x27;m just looking forward to playing more tennis. You never know what&#x27;s going to happen so let&#x27;s see.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Why is there a pineapple on Wimbledon&#x27;s men&#x27;s trophy?</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/ckg3v72er4zo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 3881 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_3e0a283b6343.png'></p>
<p>It is believed a pineapple is on the top of Wimbledon&#x27;s men&#x27;s singles trophy because of the rarity of the fruit making it a status symbol.</p>
<p>The Wimbledon championships started in 1877 and in the latter half of the 19th century, pineapples were prized as an exclusive fruit despite being first being brought back to Europe by Christopher Columbus almost 400 years earlier.</p>
<p>In the early 1900s in Hawaii pineapples were first commercially produced in order to import and grow in western Europe.</p>
<p>Because of that, the serving of pineapples was deemed as being of a higher status.</p>
<p>The current men&#x27;s singles trophy, including the pineapple, is the third iteration of the trophy.</p>
<p>The trophy is made of silver gilt and is 18 inches (46 centimetres) tall.</p>
<p>Every winner of the men&#x27;s singles trophy since 1877, the first being Spencer Gore, is engraved on the trophy.</p>
<p>All winners since 1949 have also been given a replica of the trophy to keep.</p>
<p>The winner of the women&#x27;s singles at Wimbledon is given the Venus Rosewater Dish, first awarded in 1886.</p>
<p>A rosewater dish is traditionally used to catch rosewater from jugs and is then poured over people&#x27;s hands to wash them in a daily ceremony.</p>
<p>The dish is slightly taller than the men&#x27;s trophy and is a partially gilded sterling silver salver.</p>
<p>The first recipient of this ceremonial platter was Blanche Bingley.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Why were there no line judges at Wimbledon 2025?</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cvg7zqyewyqo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> — 4186 chars</p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_94bdc180d87a.png'></p>
<p>No, line judges will not be used at Wimbledon this summer.</p>
<p>Instead, the grass-court tournament will rely solely on electronic line calling, ending its 147-year use of line judges.</p>
<p>A familiar sight around the edges of the courts for decades, the men and women who shout &quot;out&quot; and &quot;fault&quot; will be replaced by technology.</p>
<p>This technology will be in place for qualifying and the main draw.</p>
<p>Electronic line calling uses cameras, computers and sensors to track a ball and is used by tennis umpires to judge whether a ball is in or out.</p>
<p>This season the men&#x27;s tour - the ATP - has adopted the technology across all of its events, while the WTA - the women&#x27;s tour - has also been using it at many of its events.</p>
<p>The ATP said the move to electronic line calling was to &quot;optimise accuracy and consistency across tournaments, match courts and surfaces&quot;.</p>
<p>There will be a range of voices used for electronic line calling at Wimbledon this year.</p>
<p>The voices will be from those who work behind the scenes at the Championship, including tour guides at the grounds and museum.</p>
<p>&quot;We will use different voices on different courts so there is no confusion across courts that are close together,&quot; said Eloise Tyson - head of communications at Wimbledon.</p>
<p>Wimbledon have also said they are not looking to make individuals the face of electronic line calling.</p>
<p>The courts at Queen&#x27;s Club have already implemented the use of electronic line calling.</p>
<p>The Australian Open and US Open adopted electronic line calling in 2021 and 2022 respectively.</p>
<p>Roland Garros is the only Grand Slam tournament that still uses line judges and players are not allowed to use electronic replays to challenge human decision.</p>
<p>The French Open say they want to maintain traditions synonymous with the 134-year-old tournament and are unwilling to lose human control.</p>
