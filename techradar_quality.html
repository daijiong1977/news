Muji has been forced to halt much of its operations after its delivery partner, Askul, was targeted in a ransomware attack.

The Japanese clothing and homeware retailer confirmed that the incident has impacted browsing, online purchases, order histories through the Munji app, and the display of web content.

If customer data has been compromised, especially personally identifiable information like names, addresses, email addresses, or even financial data - this could leave customers at risk of identity theft, as criminals could use their information to take out credit cards or loans.

&#x27;The ASKUL website is currently experiencing a system outage due to a ransomware infection, halting order acceptance and shipping operations,&#x27; Askul&#x27;s statement confirmed (translated through Google Translate).

&#x27;We are currently investigating the extent of the impact, including the leak of personal information and customer data, and will notify you as soon as it is clear,&#x27; Askul added.

Askul only provides ecommerce logistics to the Japanese branch of Muji, so stores in other parts of the world seem to remain unaffected.

The series of retailer attacks bring forward the vulnerabilities from third-party suppliers.

The incident is the latest in a seemingly never-ending string of ransomware attacks hitting high-street stores and retailers.

Most recently, Japanese beer giant Asahi, and carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, had to halt production lines following serious cyberattacks.

These third party breaches should serve as a wake-up call for modern cybersecurity teams, and underscore the need for vigilance, accountability, and transparency.

The increased reliance on outside vendors drastically increases the attack surface that malicious actors can target. Large retailers may have the budget and manpower to bolster their cyber defenses - but smaller software, logistics, or manufacturing companies may not have the same resources or protections.

When i saw ELECTRIC, GAS and WATER my first thought was the game of Monopoly, which is an odd way of getting to UTILITIES I guess, but the brain works in mysterious ways.

As someone who once made a living as a copyWRITER (I worked on everything from an oven instruction manual to the history of a Dutch dredging company, a task now mainly outsourced to AI) I really should have got the purple group. Instead ADAPT TO FIT ONE&#x27;S NEEDS popped out.

FIRE and CARPENTER helped me get KINDS OF ANTS - a group I may have got more quickly if it included &quot;man&quot; or &quot;Adam&quot;.</div>

As I was slowly finding all these words I kept wondering: what is the connection between all of this random stuff. It wasn&#x27;t until I finally got the spangram that I realized that random stuff was the connection.

Every home has a JUNKDRAWER, although I think ours contains several - one exclusively dedicated to cables that may or may not belong to devices that were dumped many years ago, but the cables kept.

The others contain items similar to those in today&#x27;s search, roughly categorized as &quot;may be useful one day&quot;, although we all know that they never will be and if the day comes when you do need a radiator key, SHOELACE or PENCIL you will not be able to find it in the JUNKDRAWER and will go out and buy a new one instead.

A very tricky game to detect the theme of, but not too tricky in terms of searching and completing. All in all, much like finding exactly what you were looking for in the JUNKDRAWER - oddly satisfying.

Strands is the NYT&#x27;s not-so-new-any-more word game, following Wordle and Connections. It&#x27;s now a fully fledged member of the NYT&#x27;s games stable that has been running for a year and which can be played on the NYT Games site on desktop or mobile.</div>
