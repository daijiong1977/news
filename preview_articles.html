<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House on Monday started tearing down part of the East Wing, the traditional base of operations for the first lady, to build President Donald Trump&#x27;s $250 million ballroom despite lacking approval for construction from the federal agency that oversees such projects.</p>
<p>Dramatic photos of the demolition work showed construction equipment tearing into the East Wing façade and windows and other building parts in tatters on the ground. Some reporters watched from a park near the Treasury Department, which is next to the East Wing.</p>
<p>Trump announced the start of construction in a social media post and referenced the work while hosting 2025 college baseball champs Louisiana State University and LSU-Shreveport in the East Room. He noted the work was happening &quot;right behind us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;It just started today.&quot;</p>
<p>The White House has moved ahead with the massive construction project despite not yet having sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, which approves construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area.</p>
<p>Its chairman, Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary and one of Trump&#x27;s top aides, said at the commission&#x27;s September meeting that agency does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property.</p>

<p>&quot;What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build,&quot; Scharf said last month.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the White House had submitted the ballroom plans for the agency&#x27;s review and approval. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and the commission&#x27;s offices are closed because of the government shutdown.</p>
<p>The Republican president had said in July when the project was announced that the ballroom would not interfere with the mansion itself.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;ll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I&#x27;m the biggest fan of,&quot; he said of the White House.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing will be torn down,&quot; Leavitt said when she announced the project in July.</p>

<p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance arrived in Israel on Tuesday to shore up the fragile U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, following a burst of deadly violence and questions over the plan for long-term peace.</p>
<p>Watch Vance speak in the player above.</p>
<p>Vance was meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials and is expected to stay in the region until Thursday. White House envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump&#x27;s son-in-law, arrived Monday and Vance met with them upon landing.</p>
<p>Vance was also expected to meet with families of hostages whose remains are still in Gaza and some of the living hostages released last week. Witkoff and Kushner met with nine of them on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hamas said it has recovered the remains of two more hostages and planned to hand them over Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The ceasefire took effect on Oct. 10. While it has been tested by Sunday&#x27;s fighting and mutual accusations of violations, both Israel and Hamas have said they are committed to the deal. Trump has made clear he wants it to succeed.</p>
<p>The meetings highlight the urgency of launching negotiations for the second phase of the U.S. plan, which must address issues such as the disarmament of Hamas and the governance of postwar Gaza. Hamas negotiators reiterated that the group is committed to ensuring the war &quot;ends once and for all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From the day we signed the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, we were determined and committed to seeing it through to the end,&quot; Hamas chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, who is in Cairo, told Egypt&#x27;s Al-Qahera News television late Monday.</p>
<p>Israel confirmed that Palestinian militants had released the body of Tal Haimi, who was killed in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. He was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. The 42-year-old was part of its emergency response team and had four children, including one born after the attack.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the ceasefire, Israel is waiting for Hamas to turn over the remains of 15 hostages. Thirteen others have been turned over.</p>
<p>Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Israel is releasing 15 Palestinian bodies for the remains of each dead hostage, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government. It said Israel had transferred another 15 on Tuesday, for a total of 165 since earlier this month.</p>
<p>International organizations said they were scaling up humanitarian aid entering Gaza, while Hamas-led security forces launched a crackdown against what it called price gouging by private merchants.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday - not for urgent talks on how to end it but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.</p>
<p>Watch the Senate in the player above.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.</p>
<p>With both sides showing no signs of movement, it&#x27;s unclear how long the stalemate will last - even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the lunch meeting in the White House Rose Garden appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.</p>
<p>Asked about the message at lunch, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, second in Senate GOP leadership, told Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; on Tuesday that it will be, &quot;Republicans are united, and I expect the president to say, &#x27;Stand strong.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Senate Republican leader John Thune, of South Dakota said on Monday that he thinks Trump is ready to &quot;get involved on having the discussion&quot; about extending the subsidies. &quot;But I don&#x27;t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening.</p>
<p>Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.</p>
<p>And as the shutdown keeps future health costs in limbo for millions of Americans, most U.S. adults are worried about health care becoming more expensive, according to a new Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, as they make decisions about next year&#x27;s health coverage.</p>
<p>Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position remains the same: We want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,&quot; said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.</p>
<p>Schumer called the White House meeting a &quot;pep rally&quot; and said it was &quot;shameful&quot; that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.</p>
<p>Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.</p>
<p>Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn&#x27;t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, &quot;if not something on a much longer-term basis.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>U.S. appeals court says Trump can take command of Oregon National Guard troops, though deployment blocked for now</h2>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - An appeals court on Monday put on hold a lower-court ruling that kept President Donald Trump from taking command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. However, Trump is still barred from actually deploying those troops, at least for now.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders early this month - one that prohibited Trump from calling up the troops so he could send them to Portland, and another that prohibited him from sending any National Guard members to Oregon at all, after the president tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.</p>
<p>The Justice Department appealed the first order, and in a 2-1 ruling Monday, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the administration. The majority said the president was likely to succeed on his claim that he had the authority to federalize the troops based on a determination he was unable to enforce the laws without them.</p>
<p>However, Immergut&#x27;s second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed.</p>
<p>Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.</p>
<p>The administration has said that because the legal reasoning underpinning both temporary restraining orders was the same, the second one was also invalid, and the majority opinion also said the two TROs &quot;rise or fall together.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon after the ruling Monday, the Justice Department asked Immergut to immediately dissolve her second order, which would allow Trump to deploy troops to Portland. The Justice Department argued that it is not the role of the courts to second-guess the president&#x27;s determination about when to deploy troops.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision staying the first TRO is a significant change in law that plainly warrants dissolution of this Court&#x27;s second TRO,&quot; the administration&#x27;s lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat, said he would ask for a broader panel of the appeals to reconsider the decision.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#x27;s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,&quot; Rayfield said. &quot;We are on a dangerous path in America.&quot;</p>
<p>The Justice Department did not return an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>Trump&#x27;s efforts to deploy National Guard troops in Democratic-led cities have been mired in legal challenges. A judge in California ruled that his deployment of thousands of National Guard troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a longstanding law that generally prohibits the use of the military for civilian policing, and the administration on Friday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>Mostly small nightly protests, limited to a single block, have been occurring since June outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland. Larger crowds, including counterprotesters and live-streamers, have shown up at times, and federal agents have used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Scientists stumble on a hidden quantum trick in 2D materials</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083640.htm'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_4dec8bd33015.webp'></p>
<p>When arranged in just the right ways, two-dimensional materials can display unusual and valuable quantum effects such as superconductivity and exotic types of magnetism. Understanding why these effects arise, and how to control them, remains one of the biggest challenges for physicists and engineers. A new study published in Nature Physics has uncovered a previously unseen property that may explain how these mysterious quantum phases form and evolve.</p>
<p>Using a novel terahertz (THz) spectroscopy method, researchers found that thin stacks of 2D materials -- commonly used in laboratories worldwide -- can naturally create what are called cavities. These tiny spaces confine both light and electrons into even smaller regions, significantly altering their interactions and behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve uncovered a hidden layer of control in quantum materials and opened a path to shaping light-matter interactions in ways that could help us both understand exotic phases of matter and ultimately harness them for future quantum technologies,&quot; said James McIver, assistant professor of physics at Columbia and lead author of the paper.</p>
<p>The work traces its origins to Hamburg, where McIver led a research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD). The institute is part of the Max Planck-New York Center on Nonequilibrium Quantum Phenomena, a collaboration among MPSD, Columbia, the Flatiron Institute, and Cornell University. Researchers at the Center study how stable physical systems respond when pushed away from equilibrium.</p>
<p>McIver&#x27;s team explores these questions through light. &quot;2D materials, with their fascinating macroscopic properties, often behave like black boxes. By shining light on them, we can literally shed light on the hidden behavior of their electrons, revealing details that would otherwise remain unseen,&quot; said Gunda Kipp, a PhD student at MPSD and first author of the paper. One obstacle, however, is that the wavelengths of light needed to probe 2D materials are far larger than the materials themselves, which are thinner than a human hair.</p>
<p>To overcome this scale mismatch, the researchers developed a chip-sized spectroscope that compresses THz light -- the range where many quantum effects occur -- from about 1 millimeter down to just 3 micrometers. This compact design made it possible to directly observe how electrons move within 2D materials. They first tested their approach using graphene, a well-known form of carbon, to measure its optical conductivity.</p>
<p>What they found was unexpected: distinct standing waves.</p>
<p>&quot;Light can couple to electrons to form hybrid light-matter quasiparticles. These quasiparticles move as waves and, under certain conditions, they can become confined, much like the standing wave on a guitar string that produces a distinct note,&quot; explained MPSD postdoctoral fellow and co-first-author Hope Bretscher.</p>
<p>In a guitar, the string&#x27;s fixed ends define where the wave can form. Pressing a finger on the string shortens the wave, changing the pitch of the note. In optics, a similar process occurs when two mirrors trap light between them, creating a standing wave inside what scientists call a cavity. When a material is placed inside that cavity, the trapped light can repeatedly interact with it, altering its electronic properties.</p>
<p>However, the researchers discovered that mirrors might not even be necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;We found that the material&#x27;s own edges already act as mirrors,&quot; said Kipp. With their THz spectroscope, they observed that excited streams of electrons reflect off the edges to form a type of hybrid light-matter quasiparticle called a plasmon polariton.</p>
<p>The McIver lab studied a device made up of multiple layers, each of which can act as a cavity separated by a few tens of nanometers. The plasmons that form in each layer can, in turn, interact -- often strongly. &quot;It&#x27;s like connecting two guitar strings; once linked, the note changes,&quot; said Bretscher. &quot;In our case, it changes drastically.&quot;</p>
<p>The next step was to understand what determines the frequencies of these quasiparticles and how tightly light and matter couple together. &quot;With co-author and MPSD postdoctoral fellow Marios Michael, we developed an analytical theory that only needed a handful of geometric sample parameters to match the observations of our experiments,&quot; said Kipp. &quot;With just a click of a button, our theory can extract the properties of a material and will help us design and tailor future samples to obtain specific properties. For example, by tracking resonances as functions of carrier density, temperature, or magnetic field, we may uncover the mechanisms driving different quantum phases.&quot;</p>
<p>While this study focused on plasmons, the new chip-scale THz spectroscope could detect other types of quasiparticles oscillating in many different 2D materials. The team is already testing new samples in both Hamburg and New York.</p>
<p>&quot;This whole project was a bit of a serendipitous discovery. We didn&#x27;t expect to see</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Physicists discover strange spinning crystals that behave like living matter</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083635.htm'>Original</a></em></p>

<p>It may sound unbelievable, but crystals made of rotating particles are real. A group of physicists from Aachen, Düsseldorf, Mainz, and Wayne State University (Detroit, USA) has explored these unusual materials and their remarkable behavior. These crystals can easily split into separate fragments, form unusual grain boundaries, and display controllable structural defects. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the researchers present a broad theoretical framework that can predict several new properties of these so-called &quot;transverse interaction&quot; systems.</p>
<p>Rotating Systems in Nature and Technology</p>
<p>&quot;Transverse forces&quot; can appear not only in engineered materials, such as certain magnetic solids, but also in biological systems. In an experiment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), researchers observed that groups of starfish embryos, through their swimming motions, influenced each other&#x27;s movement in a way that caused them to rotate around one another. The biological function of this coordinated motion remains unclear, but it shares the same fundamental feature found in these synthetic systems: interacting, rotating objects.</p>
<p>Professor Dr. Hartmut Löwen from the Institute of Theoretical Physics II at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (HHU) explains: &quot;A system of many rotating constituent elements exhibits a qualitatively new behavior that is non-intuitive: At high concentrations, these objects form a solid body of rotors, which possess &#x27;odd&#x27; material properties.&quot;</p>
<p>One such property is known as &quot;odd elasticity.&quot; Normally, when a material is pulled, it stretches along the direction of the force. In contrast, an odd elastic material does not stretch -- it twists instead.</p>
<p>Twisting, Breaking, and Reforming</p>
<p>This kind of &quot;odd&quot; solid can even disintegrate on its own. When the rotating building blocks rub together strongly enough, the solid can fragment into many smaller spinning crystallites. Even more surprisingly, these fragments can later reassemble themselves into a coherent structure once again.</p>
<p>A research team led by Professor Dr. Zhi-Feng Huang from Wayne State University and Professor Löwen developed a multiscale theoretical model to describe the behavior of these odd crystals. Using this model, they performed simulations that revealed unexpected patterns and possible technological uses for these rotating materials.</p>
<p>Reversing the Rules of Crystal Growth</p>
<p>The team found that large crystals governed by transverse interactions tend to break down into smaller spinning units, while smaller crystals grow until reaching a specific critical size. This outcome runs counter to conventional crystal growth, where materials typically expand steadily under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>Professor Huang explains:&quot;We have discovered a fundamental property of nature underlying this process which determines the relation between the size of the critical fragments and their rotation speed.&quot;</p>
<p>Study co-author Professor Dr. Raphael Wittkowski of the DWI -- Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials and of RWTH Aachen University, adds: &quot;We furthermore demonstrated how defects in the crystals exhibit dynamics of their own. The formation of such defects can be influenced from outside, which allows properties of the crystals to be specifically controlled with a view to usage applications.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our far-reaching theory encompasses all systems evidencing such transverse interactions. Conceivable applications range from colloid research to biology,&quot; declares co-author Dr. Michael te Vrugt, Assistant Professor at the University of Mainz.</p>
<p>Professor Löwen adds: &quot;The model calculations indicate concrete application potential. The novel elastic properties of these new crystals could be exploited to invent new technical switching elements, for example.&quot;</p>
<p>In physics, interactions such as gravity and the Coulomb force are known as central forces because they act along the line connecting the centers of two bodies. These forces cause objects to move toward or away from each other.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Bird flu hiding in cheese? The surprising new discovery</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092841.htm'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_7843b5e057b3.webp'></p>
<p>Cheese made from contaminated raw milk was found to contain infectious avian influenza virus, raising potential health concerns for consumers, according to new research. The study also found that no virus was detected in samples of raw milk cheese with high acidity. Feta cheese, which is naturally more acidic, served as an example of this safer variety.</p>
<p>The findings were published on October 8 in Nature Medicine.</p>
<p>Tracking How the H5N1 Virus Behaves in Cheese</p>
<p>&quot;In this study, we were specifically looking at the stability or persistence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in raw milk cheese products,&quot; said senior author Diego Diel, professor of virology in the Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences and director of the Virology Laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC), all in the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM).</p>
<p>&quot;This research was initiated due to previous work demonstrating high levels of virus shedding in milk from infected cows and the fact that we have previously shown that the virus survives in refrigerated raw milk for extended periods of time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Virus Survived Twice as Long as Expected</p>
<p>Under Food and Drug Administration guidelines, raw milk cheese must be aged for at least 60 days at or above 35 degrees Fahrenheit. This process helps reduce moisture and destroy harmful bacteria that may be present in unpasteurized milk. However, the researchers detected infectious H5N1 virus after 120 days of aging at 39 degrees Fahrenheit, suggesting that the standard aging period may not fully eliminate viral contamination.</p>
<p>Acidity Plays a Key Role in Cheese Safety</p>
<p>A pH level below 7 is considered acidic. Most cheeses have a pH between 5.4 (as in cheddar) and 7 (as in camembert). Some, like feta, can be as low as 4.6 or even lower.</p>
<p>When the pH of raw milk cheese was between 5.8 and 6.6, the virus remained viable. No virus was detected in cheeses with a pH of 5 or below. The results highlight acidity as a key factor in inactivating the pathogen during cheesemaking.</p>
<p>According to Diel, steps to prevent contamination could include testing milk before cheesemaking and using only virus-free milk. Another option is to heat milk to sub-pasteurization temperatures, which could inactivate the virus while maintaining the raw milk cheese characteristics valued by artisanal producers.</p>
<p>Nicole Martin, study co-author and assistant research professor in dairy foods microbiology, emphasized the importance of this work: &quot;The work we&#x27;ve done on H5N1 is critical to providing practical, timely, data-driven knowledge and recommendations to the dairy industry in the face of this outbreak that has affected a large proportion of the milk supply in the U.S., and it allows raw milk cheese makers to reduce risk.&quot;</p>
<p>Animal Tests Shed Light on Transmission</p>
<p>The study also included an animal experiment using ferrets, which are highly susceptible to H5N1. The animals were fed contaminated raw milk and raw milk cheese from the study. Some ferrets that drank the raw milk became infected, but those that ate the raw milk cheese did not.</p>
<p>Diel suggested that the difference may relate to how the virus interacts with the body. The fluid consistency of milk may allow the virus to make greater contact with mucous membranes in the throat, while cheese likely provides less exposure time for infection to begin.</p>

<p>Scientists have developed a promising cancer therapy that uses LED light and ultra-thin flakes of tin to eliminate cancer cells while protecting healthy tissue. Unlike traditional chemotherapy and other invasive treatments, this new method avoids the painful side effects patients often endure.</p>
<p>The breakthrough comes from a partnership between The University of Texas at Austin and the University of Porto in Portugal, made possible through the UT Austin Portugal Program. The collaboration aims to make light-based cancer therapies more accessible and affordable. Current versions of these treatments rely on expensive materials, specialized lab setups, and powerful lasers that can sometimes damage surrounding tissue. By switching to LEDs and introducing tin-based &quot;SnOx nanoflakes&quot; (&quot;Sn&quot; is the chemical symbol for tin), the researchers have created a safer and potentially low-cost alternative.</p>
<p>LED Light and Nanoflakes Team Up Against Cancer</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal was to create a treatment that is not only effective but also safe and accessible,&quot; said Jean Anne Incorvia, a professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering&#x27;s Chandra Family Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and one of the leaders on the project. &quot;With the combination of LED light and SnOx nanoflakes, we&#x27;ve developed a method to precisely target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells untouched.&quot;</p>
<p>In a recent study published in ACS Nano, the approach proved highly effective against both colorectal and skin cancer cells. After only 30 minutes of exposure, the LED-driven treatment destroyed up to 92% of skin cancer cells and 50% of colorectal cancer cells, while leaving healthy human skin cells unharmed. The results highlight the therapy&#x27;s precision and safety.</p>
<p>A Safer Alternative to Conventional Cancer Treatments</p>
<p>Cancer remains the second-leading cause of death worldwide, and many existing treatments come with severe side effects. Scientists across the globe are exploring new methods to make therapies safer and more targeted. One of the most promising is near-infrared photothermal therapy, which uses light to heat and destroy cancer cells without the need for surgery or toxic drugs. This principle forms the foundation of the UT Austin-Portugal team&#x27;s research.</p>
<p>Having shown strong early results, the researchers are now focused on understanding how light and heat interact in the process and on testing other materials that might enhance the treatment. They also plan to design practical medical devices that can deliver the therapy directly to patients.</p>
<p>Bringing Light-Based Cancer Care to Patients</p>
<p>&quot;Our ultimate goal is to make this technology available to patients everywhere, especially places where access to specialized equipment is limited, with fewer side effects and lower cost,&quot; said Artur Pinto, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto and lead researcher of the project in Portugal. &quot;For skin cancers in particular, we envision that one day, treatment could move from the hospital to the patient&#x27;s home. A portable device could be placed on the skin after surgery to irradiate and destroy any remaining cancer cells, reducing the risk of recurrence.&quot;</p>
<p>Incorvia and Pinto first teamed up through the UT Austin Portugal Program in 2021. Since then, they have exchanged visits between Texas and Portugal and combined their expertise to explore how two-dimensional materials can be used to advance cancer therapies.</p>
<p>Expanding the Research Frontier</p>
<p>Building on their success, the team recently received additional funding through the UT Austin Portugal Program to create an implant for breast cancer patients using the same LED and nanoflake technology. Their continued collaboration could pave the way for more personalized, affordable, and pain-free cancer treatments in the near future.</p>
<p>Other co-authors of the article are: Ph.D. student Hui-Ping Chang (led development of the nanoflakes) and undergraduate student Eva Nance of The University of Texas at Austin; Filipa A.L.S. Silva (performed biological characterization), Susana G. Santos (supervised the work) and professor Fernão Magalhães (contributed to securing funding) of Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto; and José R. Fernandes of the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, who developed the LED systems.</p>
<p>The UT Austin Portugal Program is a long-standing science and technology partnership between UT and the Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology (FCT). Portugal has similar partnerships with two other U.S. universities -- the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon University -- and its 17-year collaboration with UT was recently renewed for another five years.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Scientists detect hidden brain damage years before MS symptoms</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092828.htm'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_f091656d71e1.webp'></p>
<p>By the time most people begin seeking help for multiple sclerosis (MS), the disease has already been quietly injuring the brain for years. Until recently, scientists were uncertain which cells were affected first or when the damage actually started.</p>
<p>Tracking the Disease&#x27;s Earliest Attacks</p>
<p>Researchers at UC San Francisco have now provided the most detailed timeline yet by analyzing thousands of proteins circulating in the blood. Their findings show that the immune system begins attacking the brain&#x27;s protective myelin sheath -- the fatty covering that insulates nerve fibers -- much earlier than scientists once believed.</p>
<p>The team measured fragments of myelin and other molecules left behind by immune attacks, along with the chemical signals that drive the immune system&#x27;s response. This work allowed them to outline, for the first time, the chain of biological events that ultimately leads to the onset of MS.</p>
<p>The discovery opens the door to earlier diagnosis and, in the future, may make prevention possible.</p>
<p>The Body&#x27;s Early Warning Signs</p>
<p>The research showed that MS first targets the myelin sheath. About a year later, evidence of damage to the underlying nerve fibers themselves begins to appear.</p>
<p>Among the immune-related proteins that rose during this initial stage, one stood out: IL-3. This molecule plays a central role in the early disease phase, when the central nervous system is already taking significant damage even though patients do not yet experience symptoms. IL-3 helps recruit immune cells into the brain and spinal cord, where they begin attacking nerve tissue.</p>
<p>&quot;We think our work opens numerous opportunities for diagnosing, monitoring, and possibility treating MS,&quot; said Ahmed Abdelhak, MD, assistant professor of Neurology at UCSF, and the first and co-lead author of the paper, which was published in Nature Medicine on Oct. 20. &quot;It could be a gamechanger for how we understand and manage this disease.&quot;</p>
<p>Following Blood Clues Years Before Diagnosis</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed more than 5,000 different proteins in blood samples from 134 individuals who eventually developed MS. These samples came from the U.S. Department of Defense Serum Repository, which stores blood from military applicants. Because the repository holds samples for decades, scientists were able to examine blood drawn years before these individuals were diagnosed.</p>
<p>Seven years prior to diagnosis, the researchers detected a spike in a protein known as MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein), which signals damage to the myelin insulation around nerve fibers. Roughly a year later, they observed a rise in neurofilament light chain, a marker of injury to the nerve fibers themselves.</p>
<p>During this same window, IL-3 and several related immune proteins appeared in the bloodstream, indicating that an immune assault was already underway.</p>
<p>Building the Foundation for a Predictive Blood Test</p>
<p>In total, the team identified about 50 proteins that could serve as early indicators of MS. They have since filed a patent application for a diagnostic blood test based on the 21 most reliable markers.</p>

<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-praises-the-switch-2s-divisive-game-key-cards-calling-them-a-really-fantastic-idea-for-us-developers-because-i-dont-personally-see-nintendo-working-towards-trying-to-improve-the-loading-speed-for-the-cartridges'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_45b80a43a0d8.jpg'></p>
<p>Naoki Hamaguchi believes Nintendo will try to popularize the new format instead of trying to improve the loading speed for the cartridges</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth co-director Naoki Hamaguchi has called the Switch 2&#x27;s controversial Game Key Cards &quot;a really amazing new idea&quot; that can be useful for developers and thinks Nintendo will try to make them more popular.</p>
<p>Speaking to Wccftech (via Stealth), Hamaguchi explained that cartridges themselves create loading issues that are attributed to the Switch 2&#x27;s hardware, and suggests that they&#x27;re a better alternative for developers.</p>
<p>&quot;Personally, I feel that the loading speed issue for the game cartridge is more about the hardware spec of the Nintendo Switch 2,&quot; Hamaguchi said. &quot;I&#x27;m not with Nintendo, so I can&#x27;t really speak to that side. That said, I do feel that the Game Key Card format that Nintendo created for the Nintendo Switch 2 is a really amazing new idea that they had offered for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Game Key Cards are a new form of physical Switch 2 games that contain a download key but don&#x27;t feature the full game data like other physical editions.</p>
<p>The cards are only available for a certain selection of games, but the divisiveness comes from fans worrying that the company might be moving towards a full digital output, while others suggest that, since Game-Key Cards don&#x27;t contain the full game data, players don&#x27;t have full ownership of their game after purchasing.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy surrounding them, Hamaguchi believes that Nintendo will make a push to popularize Game Key Cards instead of working to improve loading issues on cartridges.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t personally see Nintendo working towards trying to improve the loading speed for the cartridges,&quot; he said. &quot;Rather, I feel that Nintendo will put more effort into popularizing the Game Key Card format, which again is a really fantastic idea for us developers.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, we hope players familiarize themselves with what that costs them. That obviously is something we can help out with as well, from the developer side. I think that the collaborative effort between Nintendo and publishers trying to promote the Game Key Card will be the best way forward for all players in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>Hamaguchi has been doing the rounds recently, and in a separate interview with ScreenRant, the director discussed the criticism the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series has faced and disagreed with the idea that &quot;certain sections&quot; of Rebirth were too long.</p>
<p>&quot;Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in FF7 Rebirth, I honestly don&#x27;t believe that they were longer than necessary,&quot; Hamaguchi said. &quot;I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play; so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>Though he doesn&#x27;t agree with the sentiment, he did add that he was mindful of criticism, saying, &quot;As we work on the conclusion to the trilogy, we are striking a balance on how story arcs are told and spread out so as to ensure that the game feels a bit more concise.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2> Amazon plans to develop 12 small modular nuclear reactors with a near 1GW total power output, with plans to more than quintuple that number by 2039 - AI and Cloud services are first in line to benefit </h2>
<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/pro/amazon-plans-to-develop-12-small-modular-nuclear-reactors-with-a-near-1gw-total-power-output-with-plans-to-more-than-quintuple-that-number-by-2039-ai-and-cloud-services-are-first-in-line-to-benefit'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_c431efa5f79a.png'></p>
<p>Amazon bets big on nuclear energy to fuel the next wave of AI and cloud infrastructure</p>
<p>Amazon has revealed plans for the construction of 12 small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) through a partnership with X-energy and Energy Northwest as it aims for a combined output of about 1GW by the next decade.</p>
<p>The Cascade Advanced Energy Facility, set for development near Richland, Washington, will form the backbone of this new initiative.</p>
<p>Amazon says the project is part of a long-term strategy to bring over 5GW of new nuclear power to the U.S. grid by 2039.</p>
<p>If Amazon&#x27;s plan succeeds, it will mark one of the largest corporate-backed clean energy ventures to date, with the new reactors expected to provide carbon-free electricity to power its expanding digital ecosystem, including its AI tools, large-scale data centers, and cloud storage systems.</p>
<p>The SMR project is therefore seen as a way to ensure a continuous power supply to the infrastructure that supports Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other digital operations.</p>
<p>The Cascade project will use X-energy&#x27;s Xe-100 reactor design, a next-generation modular system built for scalability and safety.</p>
<p>Each unit will generate about 80MW of power, with modular construction allowing quicker deployment than traditional nuclear plants.</p>
<p>Local workforce preparation is already underway through the Department of Energy-funded Energy Learning Center at Columbia Basin College, which will host a high-fidelity simulator replicating the Xe-100 control room in a bid to train operators, engineers, and technicians for high-paying roles once the Cascade reactors enter service.</p>
<p>Amazon says the project will create over 1,000 construction jobs and more than 100 permanent technical roles.</p>
<p>The project will also support Washington State&#x27;s goal of diversifying its clean energy portfolio.</p>
<p>However, critics note that nuclear projects face long approval timelines and high upfront costs.</p>
<p>Construction of the first reactors is scheduled to begin near the end of this decade, with operations expected in the early 2030s.</p>
<p>Amazon has also partnered with Talen Energy to develop a nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>SMRs are smaller and potentially safer, but whether they will deliver on their promise of clean, scalable, and cost-effective power remains to be seen.</p>

<div class='article'><h2> Ricoh announces two GR IV variants, including a long-awaited first in the series for monochrome fans </h2>
<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/cameras/compact-cameras/ricoh-announces-two-gr-iv-variants-including-a-long-awaited-first-in-the-series-for-monochrome-fans'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_735f11b75769.jpg'></p>
<p>The Ricoh GR IV Monochrome and GR IV HDF promise to give compact camera users even more creative flexibility</p>
<p>Ricoh has announced that it is working on two new additions to its family of high-performance compact cameras, the GR IV Monochrome and GR IV HDF.</p>
<p>The Ricoh GR IV was launched back in September 2025 to mixed reviews, replacing the already fan-favorite GR III. Featuring an APS-C format sensor, the camera employs a 25.74MP resolution, a 28mm equivalent lens, a 5-axis image stabilizer, and RAW file support. It is set to become a staple of many street photographers&#x27; kitbags, thanks to its compact size, low weight, and powerful image-making engine.</p>
<p>Although compact cameras had slowed at the start of the decade, largely due to the best camera phones and affordable mirrorless cameras that have entered the market over the past few years, they are experiencing a bit of a renaissance.</p>
<p>Brands like Ricoh obviously see that there is a gap here that can be filled by a pocketable powerhouse, complete with many features previously only seen in professional or enthusiast-level interchangeable lens cameras.</p>
<p>Therefore, it wasted no time in following up on the standard GR IV with two variations, one that will be predictable to long-time devotees of the product line, and another that is a little more unexpected.</p>
<p>Ricoh&#x27;s cameras have long been considered among the best compact cameras. The Ricoh GR IV HDF (which stands for Highlight Diffusion Filter) directly replaces the Ricoh GR III HDF, launched back in March 2024. The GR IIIx, which features a slightly longer focal length lens, also received an HDF variant, so we could probably have seen this move coming.</p>
<p>The camera uses a 23.5 x 15.6 mm APS-C sensor, just like its predecessor, capable of outputting images measuring 6192 x 4128 pixels. It also enjoys 5-axis IBIS and Full HD video shooting at 60 frames per second. Meanwhile, the Highlight Diffusion Filter referenced in the name can be used to apply a unique diffusion effect for a soft and dreamy atmosphere, captured in-camera. This filter replaces the built-in 2-stop ND filter found in the standard GR III, GR IIIx, and GR IV bodies.</p>
<p>The biggest differences from the GR III HDF are a modest step up in resolution to almost 26 megapixels from 24MP, a wider sensitivity range that stretches up to 204,800 instead of 102,400, and two extra stops of image stabilization, compensating for up to 6EV rather than 4EV. You&#x27;ll also find 53GB of internal image storage compared to 2GB. These specs are, of course, also found on the standard GR IV.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ricoh GR IV Monochrome will be welcome news for black and white photographers. Following a trend seen in cameras like the Leica Q2 Monochrom and the Ricoh family&#x27;s own Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome, this body is built without the usual Color Filter Array that sits above the imaging sensor in most digital cameras.</p>
<p>The CFA enables the capture of full color images via a process of demosaicing (a fancy term for digital processing), but it does result in a loss of light-gathering capacity and detail. By removing this component, the GR IV Monochrome can only capture black and white images, but with the potential for up to a full stop of superior noise performance and increased resolution of fine textures.</p>
<p>In a press release, Ricoh mentions that the camera will also feature &quot;Image Control options specialized for black and white photography to deliver the expressiveness and depth unique to monochromatic images&quot;. Exactly what these will be is unclear at this stage, but we can expect them to include additional or further developed black and white modes, like the already well-received ones on the GR IV.</p>
<p>We are yet to be given precise release dates for either model, other than &quot;winter 2025&quot; and &quot;spring 2026&quot; for the GR IV HDF and GR IV Monochrome, respectively. Have you used a Ricoh compact? Would you choose the standard GR IV or one of these two exciting new variations? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<div class='article'><h2> The iPhone 17 series has one big winner, according to early sales – and it isn’t the iPhone Air </h2>
<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/phones/the-iphone-17-series-has-one-big-winner-according-to-early-sales-and-it-isnt-the-iphone-air'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_15b10c54a056.jpg'></p>
<p>The iPhone Air is the fresh new face of Apple&#x27;s iPhone 17 lineup, but according to some recent sales figures it&#x27;s far from the most popular model. That honor goes to its Pro-level siblings, yet one model this year has made a particularly big impressions on buyers - the base iPhone 17.</p>
<p>According to analysts at Counterpoint Research, the iPhone 17 series is a lot more popular than its iPhone 16 predecessors, with sales increasing 14% over last year&#x27;s model in its first 10 days of availability in the US and China.</p>
<p>The picture is even better when you focus on the base model in China, where Apple has sold nearly double the number of iPhone 17 handsets compared to the iPhone 16. That suggests that users are flocking to the entry-level model and see it as a more enticing option than last year&#x27;s equivalent. Combined US and China data also shows that, while the base iPhone 16 comprised 19% of the series&#x27; sales last year, for the base iPhone 17 that&#x27;s jumped to 22%.</p>
<p>At the same time, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max account for the bulk of iPhone 17-series sales, Counterpoint Research claims. This could be because carriers have offered increasingly generous subsidies to entice customers to upgrade.</p>
<p>The iPhone Air, meanwhile, is off to a modest start, with the research claiming that its short pre-order period and high price compared to the iPhone 17 makes it a &quot;niche&quot; choice for now. Yet Counterpoint Research also asserts that the iPhone Air is slightly more popular than the iPhone 16 Plus was, implying that Apple might have been right to ditch the Plus edition and replace it with the Air.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the iPhone 17&#x27;s popularity could be its suite of upgrades compared to the iPhone 16. It has a faster chip, improved display, increased storage and a better front-facing camera. At the same time, the price remains the same, making it an attractive choice that&#x27;s better value for money than ever.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the iPhone Air&#x27;s struggles could be down to how close it is in price to the iPhone 17 Pro - just $100 separates the two models. While it has a much thinner and lighter frame, it also lacks the high-end chip and sophisticated camera system that you find in the iPhone 17 Pro.</p>
<p>Across the board, the iPhone 17 series seems to be selling pretty well, with the iPhone 17 and Pro-level devices leading the way. While the iPhone Air isn&#x27;t exactly struggling, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be flying off the shelves either - and that&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve heard before.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s some hope for Apple in the fact that the iPhone Air isn&#x27;t expected to be available in China until late October. While there&#x27;s no doom and gloom yet, Apple will surely be hoping it ends up being more popular there than it has been elsewhere.</p>
