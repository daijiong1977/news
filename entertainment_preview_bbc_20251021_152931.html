<p>British designer Grace Wales Bonner has been named as the new creative director of menswear for French fashion house Hermès.</p>
<p>The appointment means Wales Bonner, a 35-year-old Londoner, is now the first black woman to lead design at a major fashion house, according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>In a statement, Wales Bonner said she was &quot;deeply honoured to be entrusted with the role&quot;.</p>
<p>She replaces Véronique Nichanian, who has been the company&#x27;s artistic director of menswear division for 37 years.</p>
<p>Her final collection for the brand will be shown in Paris in January, while Wales Bonner&#x27;s first collection will launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In her statement, Wales Bonner said: &quot;It is a dream realised to embark on this new chapter, following in a lineage of inspired craftspeople and designers.&quot;</p>
<p>She also thanked the company&#x27;s bosses &quot;for the opportunity to bring my vision to this magical house&quot;.</p>
<p>Reporting the news on Tuesday, Vogue said: &quot;While industry insiders were betting on a promotion from within, Hermès went for a renowned talent.&quot;</p>
<p>Wales Bonner, who was born in London to an English mother and Jamaican father, founded her own label in 2014, not long after graduating from London&#x27;s Central Saint Martins College of Art.</p>
<p>According to Vogue, Wales Bonner will continue her namesake brand alongside her new Hermès role.</p>
<p>She dressed F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, musician FKA Twigs, and actor Jeff Goldblum for this year&#x27;s Met Gala and has made T-shirts with musician Solange Knowles, younger sister of Beyoncé.</p>
<p>Wales Bonner has also curated an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and hosted musical performances at London&#x27;s Serpentine Galleries.</p>
<p>She has had a long-standing collaboration with Adidas and was made a MBE in 2022 for services to fashion.</p>
<p>Pierre-Alexis Dumas, general artistic director of Hermès, said: &quot;I am really pleased to welcome Grace to the Hermès artistic director family.</p>
<p>&quot;Her take on contemporary fashion, craft and culture will contribute to shaping Hermès men&#x27;s style, melding the house&#x27;s heritage with a confident look on the now.</p>

<p>Bad Boy Chiller Crew forgive anyone who forgot about them.</p>
<p>The trio&#x27;s brand of Bradford bassline earned them a UK top 10 single with BMW in 2022.</p>
<p>And their first album, Disrespectful, would have made number one if Ed Sheeran&#x27;s = (Equals) hadn&#x27;t got in its way.</p>
<p>By 2023 Gareth &quot;GK&quot; Kelly, Kane Welsh and Sam &quot;Clive&quot; Robinson were riding high, nominated for group of the year at the Brits alongside The 1975 and Arctic Monkeys.</p>
<p>Just as they were building momentum, they tell BBC Newsbeat, they were forced to hit pause when a legal dispute erupted with record label House Anxiety.</p>
<p>Unable to release new tracks, they swapped making music for combing through contracts. Kane says it was like &quot;jogging on the spot&quot;.</p>
<p>In July, a judge confirmed that a deal between the band and the record label had expired.</p>
<p>The group admit they&#x27;d considered going their separate ways during their hiatus.</p>
<p>&quot;I was ready to give it up,&quot; GK tells Newsbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn&#x27;t earn a living. What we had left got thrown into solicitor and court fees.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the worst time of our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Kane says it&#x27;s a relief to share music they&#x27;ve had ready and waiting on hard drives for months.</p>
<p>&quot;We were putting all this work and effort in, eight hours a day, making music that we couldn&#x27;t even release,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>GK adds: &quot;But what we&#x27;re trying to do is bring the old sound back.&quot;</p>
<p>The band are drip-feeding fans remixes of songs from their breakthrough mixtape, Full Wack No Breaks.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now</h2>
<p><em>BBC Entertainment - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4nr1415wo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_96d9a7c811a1.webp'></p>
<p>The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair&#x27;s tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.</p>
<p>Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears&#x27;s allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.</p>
<p>Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.</p>
<p>Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book&#x27;s release by publisher Listenin.</p>
<p>He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.</p>
<p>When they were teenagers, the couple&#x27;s sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. &quot;They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - &#x27;Oh, you&#x27;re awake?&#x27; - with a knife in her hand,&quot; he writes. &quot;Then she&#x27;d turn around and pad off without explanation.&quot;</p>
<p>Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: &quot;The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it&#x27;s racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we&#x27;re getting close to the 11th hour.&quot;</p>
<p>He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears&#x27;s life were controlled by others for years, and described it as a &quot;lifeline&quot; in its early days.</p>
<p>He claims Spears saw the events in her life &quot;through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one&quot;, but that she &quot;needed help&quot; and was &quot;in no state to responsibly manage her own affairs&quot;.</p>
<p>Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could &quot;never fully get behind it&quot;.</p>
<p>The pair got together in the summer of 2004, as Spears&#x27;s initial commercial peak started to wane.</p>
<p>They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.</p>
<p>Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.</p>
<p>The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.</p>
<p>In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.</p>
