<div class='article'><h2>Bank of America revamps Google stock price target ahead of earnings</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/investing/bank-of-america-revamps-google-stock-price-target-ahead-of-earnings'>Original</a> — 2998 chars</p>
<p>Google&#x27;s 2025 felt like driving an F1 car in city traffic, as the tech behemoth powered through with occasional hard brakes.</p>
<p>It kicked off the year with Gemini everywhere, layered through Search, YouTube, and Workspace, which quietly turned Google&#x27;s apps into AI-native tools. YouTube kept flexing its flywheel (shorts and connected TV), while Google Cloud tightened execution with major wins and steadier profitability.</p>
<p>However, it wasn&#x27;t all smooth sailing.</p>
<p>AI Overviews drew a ton of scrutiny, with rivals poking into its durable search moat, and regulators kept Google on speed dial. Waymo faced plenty of safety-related questions, while the legal meter kept humming.</p>
<p>That said, a fresh read from Bank of America lands now with extra weight ahead of Google&#x27;s Q3 earnings print.</p>
<p>One top-ranked BofA analyst just reset his price target on Alphabet stock ahead of earnings, with the substance sitting in the details.</p>
<p>The timing of the note points to something worth a much closer look.</p>

<p>Ahead of Google-parent Alphabet&#x27;s October 29 earnings report, Bank of America&#x27;s Justin Post just bumped his price target on the stock to $280 from $252, while maintaining a buy rating. His updated new rating implies nearly an 11% upside from current levels.</p>
<p>Post&#x27;s reasoning is straightforward.</p>
<p>Also, his revenue forecast now sits at $86 billion, nudging it above Wall Street&#x27;s $85 billion consensus.</p>

<p>Moreover, he is modeling earnings per share of $2.17, slightly below consensus due to roughly $3.9 billion in legal charges, but acknowledging that the underlying profitability remains intact.</p>
<p>Post isn&#x27;t ignoring the bigger themes, either. He expects Google to focus on broader Gemini AI adoption across products and build on its strength in the Cloud, where new customer wins continue to fuel backlog and bottom-line expansion.</p>
<p>Alphabet is heading into Q3 with a decent head of steam.</p>
<p>Its Q2 results came out clean, with its EPS landing at $2.31 (GAAP and normalized), beating estimates by $0.12 and $0.11, respectively, while its revenue hit $96.43 billion, a hefty $2.39 billion beat.</p>

<p>For Q3, Wall Street&#x27;s modeling $2.29 EPS on $99.97 billion in revenue. Estimate revisions have leaned mostly positive over 90 days (29 up versus 12 down), which is a quiet vote of confidence in ads, Cloud, and AI.</p>
<p>Investors will zero in on Search and YouTube Shorts engagement, especially if paid clicks and CPCs hold; a massive win for the &quot;AI isn&#x27;t killing search&quot; camp.</p>
<p>Cloud margin stability is also an imperative, with investors looking for opex discipline and healthy backlog signals. Gemini traction is also important, especially in Search, Workspace, and dev tools.</p>
<p>That said, here are Alphabet&#x27;s recent earnings at a glance over the past five quarters:</p>

<div class='article'><h2>SpaceX gets the wakeup call it needs from the US government</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/latest-news/spacex-gets-the-wakeup-call-it-needs-from-the-us-government'>Original</a> — 3349 chars</p>
<p>Shareholders have called Elon Musk&#x27;s focus into question in the past, so Tesla, one of a handful of companies Musk leads, has devised a trillion-dollar plan to keep Musk engaged.</p>
<p>Tesla has proposed the biggest pay package in modern history, which could potentially pay Musk an unprecedented $1 trillion if he reaches some serious benchmarks.</p>
<p>The company believes this carrot will help Musk turn his attention back to building Tesla, and away from things that have nothing to do with his business, like politics and online trolling.</p>
<p>While investors won&#x27;t vote on this proposal until the company&#x27;s November 6 annual shareholder meeting, the strategy has not worked in the short-term.  Musk still spends a lot of time tweeting far-right conspiracy theories and propaganda to his millions of loyal followers.</p>
<p>While Musk claims he has more than enough bandwidth to troll online while also running Tesla, SpaceX, X, xAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and other ventures, one government official says one of his most valuable companies is already dropping the ball.</p>

<p>NASA has had a very fruitful relationship with SpaceX, but on Oct. 20, acting chief Sean Duffy said he is growing so frustrated with the company that NASA could start looking for alternative contractors.</p>
<p>Duffy told CNBC that SpaceX is behind schedule on its commitment to build the lunar lander that astronauts would take to the moon as part of its $2.9 billion contract with the government. He said NASA may soon seek a different partner if the company doesn&#x27;t get its act together.</p>
<p>Related: Fast-growing rival comes for SpaceX&#x27;s throne</p>
<p>&quot;They push their timelines out, and we&#x27;re in a race against China,&quot; Duffy told CNBC. &quot;So, I&#x27;m going to open up the contract. I&#x27;m going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX.&quot;</p>
<p>SpaceX signed the nearly $3 billion government contract in 2021. It helped solidify the fledgling company as a powerhouse in space travel as the country with the most advanced space program gave it the stamp of approval.</p>
<p>Since then, SpaceX&#x27;s valuation has ballooned from $100 billion to reports of over $400 billion.</p>
<p>But it has recently run into trouble as Starship, the vessel that will lead NASA&#x27;s lunar push, blew up in flight three times this year, although it&#x27;s also had a few successful suborbital flight tests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this isn&#x27;t the first time Duffy has called out Elon Musk this year.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump handpicked Sean Duffy to lead the Department of Transportation. Since Duffy took the job, the president in July also promoted him to serve as acting administrator of NASA.</p>
<p>Duffy has butted heads with Musk over cuts the Department of Government Efficiency tried to make at the Department of Transportation, the government agency tasked with regulating electric vehicle maker Tesla, among other responsibilities.</p>
<p>Apparently, Musk wanted Duffy to fire air traffic controllers at a time when the DOT is facing staffing issues.</p>
<p>&quot;Safety-critical positions are not going to be fired within the Department of Transportation. We can do things more efficiently ... but we are not going to fire air controllers,&quot; Duffy said earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Elon - or no one else - is the Secretary. I am. The Senate confirmed me.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Walmart is selling an attractive outdoor wicker bar table for just $95</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/deals/ktaxon-outdoor-wicker-bar-table-walmart-flash-sale'>Original</a> — 2975 chars</p>
<p>TheStreet aims to feature only the best products and services.  If you buy something via one of our links, we may earn a commission.</p>
<p>The backyard shindig isn&#x27;t just for summer. In fact, considering how oppressive summer heat is these days, there are few parties that hit as well as the autumn evening get-together. Crisp fall breezes, roaring fire pits, and, if you&#x27;re lucky, tasty cocktails being whipped up by the host. If you plan on entertaining in fall, winter, or any season, you&#x27;ll need the right bar table that&#x27;s sturdy enough to hold drinks, snacks, and perhaps an entire buffet.</p>
<p>Right now, Walmart is selling the attractive and surprisingly roomy Ktaxon Outdoor Wicker Bar Table for just $95 with one of its limited-time Flash sales. It normally goes for $130, but you can save $35 if you add this lovely piece of outdoor furniture to your cart right now. Shoppers love it, calling it &quot;durable, functional, and quick to assemble.&quot; What more could you ask for in a piece of outdoor furniture?</p>
<p>When purchasing furniture for decks, patios, and backyards, people usually default to the standard tables and chairs, with something offbeat like hammocks occasionally thrown in. However, when adorning an outdoor space, sometimes it helps to consider indoor furniture, especially when it comes to entertaining.</p>
<p>This wicker bar table is just like a mini bar you might have inside, only it&#x27;s made for outside use. Shoppers love how versatile this table is, especially when it comes to entertaining.</p>
<p>&quot;We can either use it to spread out snacks or fun summer outdoor drinks, depending on the company,&quot; one shopper said. &quot;The covered shelves actually prevent rain from soaking our paper plates and plastic silverware.&quot;</p>
<p>With two layers of storage just under the table, you can perpetually house everything, including bottles of rum, mugs, dessert plates, those little cocktail umbrellas, party hats, or even a book or two for when you want to lounge outside on cozy days. And while there&#x27;s room for highball and martini glasses, there are dedicated racks just under the tabletop for wine glasses.</p>
<p>Despite being rather low profile, the tabletop is surprisingly roomy at 54 inches long. There&#x27;s plenty of room to mix drinks, lay out rows of snacks, or even a couple of diners, as long as they don&#x27;t mind eating standing up. Outdoor parties are casual that way.</p>

<p>This table will require some assembly, but it&#x27;s relatively easy and quick, according to reviewers. Another point in the win column for this wicker bar is how unbelievably durable it is. One shopper claimed that a tree fell on their bar table, and while scuffed, it was still standing upright and ready to be used.</p>
<p>If you do a lot of backyard entertaining, you need the Ktaxon Outdoor Wicker Bar Table in your life. It retails for $130, but you can shop it at Walmart right now for just $95 with this limited-time Flash sale.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Hotel subscriptions are becoming popular but are they worth it</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/travel/hotel-subscriptions-are-becoming-popular-but-are-they-worth-it'>Original</a> — 2341 chars</p>
<p>With industries like airlines to chain restaurants now selling subscriptions to their regular customers, hotels have become the latest to enter this space with membership programs in which one can pay a monthly or annual fee to get access to anything from late check out and automatic upgrades to set prices for booked nights.</p>
<p>The latest hotel giant to launch a paid membership program is Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts. Expanding the regular loyalty program known as Wyndham Rewards, the New Jersey-based giant between 9,200 hotels globally has announced the Wyndham Rewards Insider for those who want to shell out $95 a year for additional perks.</p>
<p>These include 10% off standard rates at Wyndham properties around the world, an automatic boost to the Gold loyalty status that would otherwise be reached after five nights at a qualifying property and discounts of between 5% and 10% on flights, vacation packages, cars, tours and concert and other activity tickets booked through the chain&#x27;s various travel and transportation partnerships.</p>
<p>Related: These hotels just got the equivalent of three Michelin stars</p>
<p>&quot;The world of travel rewards is changing,&quot; Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts Chief Commercial Officer Scott Strickland said in a statement. &quot;[...] Historically, such benefits were reserved only for the travel elite, off-limits to those without high-fee, premium credit cards. Wyndham Rewards Insider flips that script, putting the power back in the hands of everyday travelers - all for less than the cost of a night out.&quot;</p>
<p>As such hotel subscriptions become more common and increasingly start to get adopted by bigger chains, several industry analysts have weighed in on whether they are worth it or will become yet another subscription that one signs up for and forgets about until the charge reappears on one&#x27;s credit card.</p>
<p>In general, hotel subscriptions can still be useful to travelers who do not spend enough to accrue status since they can translate into an immediate discount or free night through the sign-up points bonus but will only be maximized for those who travel regularly and consistently stay with the same brand. Without the sign-up bonus, the discount offered immediately at sign-up will usually not be enough to make up for the annual fee.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Amazon and Chewy just got a major vote of confidence: Here’s why</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/economy/amazon-and-chewy-just-got-a-major-vote-of-confidence-heres-why'>Original</a> — 4227 chars</p>
<p>Online shopping isn&#x27;t just coming back; it&#x27;s growing smarter, quicker, and more customized.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not simply improved technology that leads to growth; it&#x27;s also deeper integration. AI is beginning to make online stores more personal in real time, while fulfillment robots and drone deliveries are making it easier to get things right away.</p>
<p>As Bank of America analysts wrote:</p>
<p>AI-driven shopping experiences will continue to get better.</p>
<p>With that in mind, certain prominent companies, including Amazon and Chewy, may be more prepared than others to ride the next wave.</p>
<p>The digital shopping upswing is gaining steam, and AI is gradually taking over.</p>
<p>Inflation, tariffs, and the odd bankruptcy are in the news a lot lately, but there is a deeper change going on behind the scenes. Online shopping is become quicker, easier, and more intuitive than ever thanks to things like algorithmic customization, warehouse robots, and AI-generated product discovery.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not simply hype about technology. Bank of America says that worldwide eCommerce sales will reach $4.85 trillion in 2026, which is a 10% increase from 2025. That rate is far faster than the company&#x27;s prediction of 3% worldwide GDP growth, which shows how rapidly digital retail is exceeding other economic trends.</p>
<p>Growth in the U.S. is almost as great. BofA thinks the real growth rate for online gross merchandise volume is around 10% in 2025, although official data shows a lower pace. GMV is predicted to rise 9% year over year to $1.34 trillion.</p>
<p>Related: Samsung, Apple AI take different approaches to AI surge</p>
<p>One standout insight: &quot;Online penetration of total retail [is projected] to expand 100bps y/y to 17.5% in 2026.&quot; If that happens, it would mark a key recovery milestone - and possibly the start of a new AI-led phase in how Americans shop.</p>
<p>A major tailwind is the expected launch of Agentic AI shopping, which lets smart bots not only suggest items but also make purchases depending on user objectives, preferences, or budgets. That change might make the purchase process more faster and push people even more toward digital.</p>
<p>Not all eCommerce stocks are the same, but Bank of America thinks two of them, Amazon and Chewy, are the best ones to buy before 2026.</p>
<p>Amazon is still the best large-cap stock, since it is the leader in both digital retail and cloud infrastructure. Analysts point out that Amazon is growing its food business, using robots to improve its margins while using Prime to develop a strong position in Agentic AI purchasing.</p>
<p>That provides the corporation an advantage in terms of structure as AI starts to play a bigger part in how people shop.</p>
<p>But Amazon isn&#x27;t the only name well positioned.</p>
<p>Related: Inside the secret chip tour Intel didn&#x27;t want you to see</p>
<p>Chewy, which has long been considered as a niche pet player, is now becoming a high-upside SMID cap.</p>
<p>BofA likes the firm because it might gain market share, increase profits via automation, and avoid some of the problems that other retailers are seeing in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Chewy hasn&#x27;t only depended on the pandemic to help it grow, as a lot of mid-caps have. Instead, it&#x27;s developing a strong moat with returning customers and good logistics.</p>
<p>Related: Palantir&#x27;s Pentagon dream just hit a classified snag</p>
<p>The analyst note also shows that the market is split. BofA&#x27;s U.S. eCommerce coverage is trading at roughly 2.7 times projected EV/sales.</p>
<p>However, this average belies a big difference: Large caps are up 37% this year, while SMID companies are down 7%. That difference shows there may be selective chances and potential upside in stocks like Chewy if the mood changes.</p>
<p>The internet shopping experience is about to see big changes, from Agentic AI to drone delivery. There are still significant threats like tariffs and inflation, but the move toward online buying isn&#x27;t over yet.</p>
<p>As more and more stores use automation and AI to personalize shopping experiences, businesses with the proper tech stack and dedicated customers may have the upper hand.</p>
<p>The lesson for investors is clear: in a $4.85 trillion eCommerce sector, it&#x27;s more important than ever to select the right names.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>A major airline may have to ban all in-flight alcohol (yes, really)</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/travel/a-major-airline-may-have-to-ban-all-in-flight-alcohol-yes-really'>Original</a> — 2897 chars</p>
<p>But one Asian flag carrier could end up having to take the radical step of banning all in-flight alcohol under pressure from religious lawmakers.</p>
<p>Increasingly, however, it has faced growing pressure to follow the lead of airlines from Muslim-majority countries such as Saudia, Kuwait Airways, and Air Arabia in not serving any alcohol at all.</p>
<p>During a parliamentary budget meeting earlier in October, an MP from the far-right islamist political party Perikatan Nasional (PN) called out the airline for a situation in which Muslim flight attendants could be forced to serve alcohol to guests against their Islamic religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Politicians from the even more fundamentalist Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) have filed an official proposal that would require Malaysia Airlines to swap any wine, beer, or champagne with traditional Malaysian drinks such as sirap bandung.</p>
<p>While the proposal has not moved forward beyond being raised in parliament, the increasing discussion around getting rid of alcohol has raised the alarm of tourism groups, which say that a full ban will drive away tourism and portray Malaysia as a radical country to Western tourists.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a religious issue,&quot; Member of the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly Wong Soon Koh said to a local outlet. &quot;It&#x27;s about Malaysia&#x27;s economy and survival. Malaysia Airlines is still struggling to recover, and now the Hulu Selangor MP is adding salt to the wound.&quot;</p>
<p>Related: TSA says this type of drink is now banned from all US planes</p>
<p>Koh said further that Malaysia Airlines does &quot;not only earn from Malaysia - it earns from travelers around the world from every religion and background.&quot;</p>
<p>Amid efforts to bring in more international tourists through campaigns like Visit Malaysia 2026, the Malaysian government reported a 20% increase in international arrivals between January and May 2025, with larger increases predicted once the number for the rest of the year is calculated.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Malaysia Airlines also added new flights or expanded frequencies to countries such as Australia, New Zealand, India, and China.</p>
<p>No international airlines currently offer direct flights between Malaysia and the United States, but the country is becoming an increasingly popular destination for American travelers looking to see new destinations after already visiting places such as Japan, Thailand, and Singapore.</p>
<p>A number of tourist groups spoke out over what they see as a sudden ban&#x27;s potential to reverse this trend.</p>
<p>&quot;Malaysia is known as a moderate tourism country,&quot; Nigel Wong, who heads the local Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents, said to local outlet VNExpress on the alcohol ban discussions. &quot;We emphasize values like tolerance, acceptance, and inclusiveness. That&#x27;s what makes Malaysia so appealing as a tourism destination.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>AT&amp;T sends harsh warning to customers</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/retail/att-sends-harsh-warning-to-customers'>Original</a> — 4070 chars</p>
<p>AT&amp;T (T) and other rival phone carriers are currently benefiting from a major shift in customer behavior that is boosting their profits.</p>
<p>Consumers nationwide are cutting the cord on traditional internet services provided by cable companies such as Comcast and Spectrum as prices go up.</p>
<p>As an alternative, many consumers are switching to fixed wireless internet services, which are cheaper than traditional internet provided by cable companies. Phone carriers including AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile offer fixed wireless internet, also known as 5G home internet.</p>
<p>&quot;Although 5G home internet technically isn&#x27;t faster than cable or fiber internet, it offers a lot of value,&quot; said Peter Holslin, managing editor at Reviews.org, in the survey. &quot;5G internet packages are typically sold at fixed rates, with no extra fees for installation or equipment, and you often get other perks too like unlimited data and bundle discounts when you pair it with a cell phone plan from the same provider.&quot;</p>
<p>A recent survey from Cord Cutters News revealed that only 40.2% of consumers now rely on cable TV companies for their internet service, a significant decrease from 45% in late 2024. Also, roughly 11% rely on 5G home internet, up from 8.4% just a year ago.</p>
<p>Amid this growing trend, AT&amp;T welcomed 203,000 new AT&amp;T Internet Air (5G home internet) customers during the second quarter of this year. It also gained 243,000 new fiber internet customers.</p>
<p>Related: AT&amp;T&#x27;s harsh new policy for employees hits a snag</p>
<p>Customers with bundled packages that include internet, TV, or phone services will also see the internet portion of their bill increase by $5.</p>
<p>&quot;To ensure we continue providing the quality service and support you deserve, the price of your home internet plan will increase by $5/month, starting December 1, 2025,&quot; said AT&amp;T in an email to customers.</p>
<p>In a statement to TheVerge, an AT&amp;T spokesperson said the company is increasing the prices of its internet services due to &quot;increasing operational costs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As we work to meet the evolving needs of our business and manage increasing operational costs, we&#x27;re adjusting our internet plan rates to help maintain the high-quality service our customers expect,&quot; said the AT&amp;T spokesperson. &quot;We&#x27;re committed to keeping customers informed about these updates and their choices. To help offset these changes, customers who have not already enrolled in Autopay and Paperless Billing can receive a $10 monthly discount by enrolling with an eligible bank account, or a $5 discount with a debit card. Customers can review all details regarding their plan and associated fees on their monthly statements or by visiting att.com.&quot;</p>
<p>The move from AT&amp;T comes after it increased its internet prices by $5 in November last year. Some AT&amp;T fiber internet customers also faced a $5 increase in 2023.</p>
<p>In April this year, the company also reduced its monthly discount for autopay and paperless billing. Internet customers who pay their monthly bill with a debit card saw their discount shrink from $10 to $5, and customers who pay their bill with a credit card had their autopay and paperless billing discount completely removed.</p>
<p>Many AT&amp;T internet customers took to the social media platform Reddit to express frustration with the latest round of price increases. Some claimed that the internet service wasn&#x27;t worth the higher price due to recent outages.</p>
<p>&quot;You guys don&#x27;t even have stability right now and have gone out 3x in the past 3 months and you want us to pay more? You&#x27;ve lost your minds. I&#x27;m switching immediately,&quot; wrote one AT&amp;T customer in the comment section of a Reddit post discussing the price increase.</p>
<p>&quot;I received this notice the same day my home internet stopped working for 2 days straight. Feels like a slap in the face, paying even more for a service that doesn&#x27;t work when you need it,&quot; wrote another customer.</p>
<p>&quot;ATT advertised the price was not just an intro rate like other providers. I&#x27;m pissed about another price increase,&quot; claimed another.</p>

<p>Tracking mud inside your entryway or shaking snow off your boots all over your kitchen floor makes a giant, slippery mess. Cute welcome mats have their time and place, but to get through rainy fall and spring seasons and handle snowy winters, a heavy-duty doormat that absorbs water and keeps dirt outside where it belongs can save you from having to clean up after every trip outside. One of Amazon&#x27;s top-rated waterproof doormats is on sale at an absolute steal right now, and it&#x27;s an outstanding choice for anyone who needs an affordable solution for dealing with slippery floors at home.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014 by two working moms and pet owners who wanted durable and strong home essentials that still looked nice, Gorilla Grip products are a fan favorite of homeowners. All of the brand&#x27;s products undergo rigorous testing to ensure high-quality and safety standards are met, and this waterproof indoor outdoor rug is no exception.</p>
<p>This mat&#x27;s all-weather construction includes a stain-, weather-, and fade-resistant topside woven from synthetic fibers, paired with a durable natural rubber backing that provides higher tensile strength and tear resistance than standard doormats. Deep grooves in a diamond-shaped pattern and a beveled rubber border capture mud, dirt, sand, and moisture, while the textured surface traps debris before it tracks inside.</p>
<p>Related: Walmart is selling a &#x27;very sturdy&#x27; over-the-door storage organizer for only $20</p>
<p>A low-profile design allows doors to close over this mat without catching, so it&#x27;s versatile for indoor use, too - like under your dog&#x27;s water bowl or in a mudroom. Unlike thin mats that shred or slide, this doormat&#x27;s retention dam prevents water pooling, and the non-slip backing grips hardwood, tile, or carpet. It&#x27;s a particularly useful choice for high-traffic areas like entryways or kitchens where pets or kids might bring in snow, sand, or grass clippings.</p>
<p>With nearly 5,000 five-star reviews on Amazon and an average rating of 4.4 out of five stars, this rug is one of the retailer&#x27;s top-rated weatherproof doormats. Shoppers are particularly impressed with this mat&#x27;s ability to hold up in high-traffic areas without slipping or shredding.&quot;I love this mat. It stays in place, is durable, and works great,&quot; a satisfied shopper shared. One pet owner commented that the mat &quot;stops people and pets from bringing the outside inside.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Budget airline that filed for Chapter 11 gets surprising buyer</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/travel/budget-airline-that-filed-for-chapter-11-gets-surprising-buyer'>Original</a> — 3198 chars</p>
<p>With a territory of nearly three million square miles but a population of just 27 million people, Australia is a difficult place to launch and operate low-cost airlines, due to the high costs, coupled with a relatively small potential client base.</p>
<p>Earlier in October, two U.S. executives from the financial company that helped launch Queensland-based budget carrier Bonza were charged with fraud of over $500 million over allegedly &quot;pledging assets that [the] firm did not own, falsifying bank statements, and making other material misrepresentations&quot; about the state of its finances both to investors and companies into which they put money.</p>
<p>In April 2024, creditors began seizing Bonza&#x27;s fleet of aircraft over unpaid debt, and the carrier had to abruptly shut down operations, leaving thousands of travelers in airports across rural Australia stranded with canceled flights.</p>
<p>Launched in 2002 from the merger of two regional airlines, Sydney-based low-cost carrier Rex Airlines has been under voluntary administration (the Australian equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy) since July 2024 after running out of funds and having to stop operating all but a few regional flights funded by Asian investment firm PAG and the local state government.</p>
<p>The airline was also forced to withdraw from trading on the Australian Stock Exchange over investor fears that the carrier could collapse at any moment. Meanwhile, on its website, Rex states that any flights it sells have a &quot;federal government regional flight booking guarantee.&quot;</p>
<p>Related: American airline brings back very long flight to New Zealand</p>
<p>After more than a year in bankruptcy proceedings overseen by administrators from Ernst &amp; Young, Rex has just been given an unexpected Hail Mary after E&amp;Y confirmed that Minneapolis-based aviation company Air T plans to buy the beleaguered carrier.</p>
<p>Few financial details about the transaction have been released, but Air T is a wider parent company with branches in cargo, commercial aircraft, and ground support.</p>
<p>&quot;The administrators would like to thank the Australian government for their support to date in assisting to facilitate the proposed transaction,&quot; E&amp;Y said in a statement on the sale.</p>
<p>Since the company filed for bankruptcy, a judge has extended the deadline for Rex to find a buyer three times while also giving up $80 million in debts so the airline could keep running.</p>
<p>While Rex owed over 4,800 creditors a combined $500 million, E&amp;Y said &quot;no return to shareholders is anticipated.&quot;</p>
<p>Given the airline&#x27;s critical role in providing service between Australian cities and remote rural communities, it has been permitted to exit bankruptcy through a sale that does not take on its heavy debt load.</p>
<p>&quot;Reliable air connectivity is fundamental to the social and economic wellbeing of regional Australia,&quot; Australian Airports Association CEO Simon Westaway said in a statement.</p>
<p>Details of the proposed sale reported by news.com.au say that Air T has agreed to help Rex restructure its financing arrangements and file a plan for a profitable way forward given ongoing challenges amid a limited market and aging aircraft.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Cybersecurity expert offers blunt verdict on AWS outage</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/technology/cybersecurity-expert-offers-blunt-verdict-on-aws-outage'>Original</a> — 4132 chars</p>
<p>For what felt like forever on Monday, Oct. 21, the internet&#x27;s pulse flatlined.</p>
<p>Food-delivery apps froze, Fortnite gamers got booted mid-battle, and Venmo payments disappeared mid-transfer. Most would have guessed a massive cyberattack or hack, but it turned out to be something far more ordinary and perhaps more alarming: a bad day inside Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>The glitch started in AWS&#x27;s US-EAST-1 regionin Northern Virginia, where a subsystem fault monitoring network load balancers spiraled into a massive outage.</p>
<p>The result was global chaos across thousands of platforms, from Snapchat and Reddit to Zoom, Coinbase, and even government services.</p>
<p>Downdetector reports millions of problem reports came in at the peak, with analysts pegging the number of affected businesses at more than 1,000. However, investors largely shrugged it off, with Amazon stock ending higher as service slowly returned.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s important to note that AWS is essentially the quiet engine keeping the digital world afloat.</p>
<p>With a 30% market share in cloud infrastructure, it races ahead of its competition in Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, anchoring a $100 billion-a-quarter industry. For more color, AWS generated a whopping$10.2 billion in operating income in the previous quarter, with more than 50% of Amazon&#x27;s total $19.2 billion.</p>
<p>In making sense of all the hullabaloo, cybersecurity expert David Kennedy just dropped a curt and pertinent take on the AWS outage.</p>
<p>Kennedy is the founder ofTrustedSec and a career offensive-security operator who has led red-team hunts for Fortune 500s along with several public agencies. Additionally, he&#x27;s a former Marine and co-founded Binary Defense, developing widely used open-source pen-testing tools while helping to organize major industry conferences.</p>

<p>AWS blinked this week, and much of the internet bore the brunt of it.</p>
<p>From crypto exchanges to banks, entire operations went quiet, and that&#x27;s exactly what TrustedSec founder David Kennedy says is a wake-up call for every business that&#x27;s betting big on the cloud.</p>
<p>&quot;This wasn&#x27;t a hack,&quot; Kennedy told CNBC&#x27;s The Exchange. &quot;But it shows how fragile our infrastructure is.&quot; He further went on to say that something as simplistic as &quot;a small DNS change&quot; could ripple across critical systems.</p>
<p>Kennedy noted that AWS has had multiple outages in the past as well, and warned that redundancy remains the weak point.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully Amazon&#x27;s looking at this and saying, can we roll over to another data center so we don&#x27;t see these massive outages?&quot;</p>
<p>Beyond Amazon, Kennedy feels the core of the problem stretches across the tech ecosystem. &quot;Everything from Coinbase to government installations went down,&quot; he said. &quot;When one data center fails, it cascades.&quot;</p>
<p>Related: Bank of America resets inflation prediction ahead of CPI</p>
<p>He also sounded the alarm on the growing convergence of IT and operational technology, including everything from utilities to financial systems, as a potential flashpoint.</p>
<p>This wasn&#x27;t the first AWS disruption, and the list below, covering the biggest ones in the past five years, is proof that even the world&#x27;s most reliable cloud has vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Oct. 20, 2025: US-EAST-1 (global ripple)</p>
<p>The hack lasted for roughly 15 hours, linked to an internal fault tied to network load balancers in AWS&#x27;s largest region, which froze services such as Snapchat, Reddit, Venmo, Alexa, and Fortnite.</p>
<p>A capacity-management subsystem error knocked out over 100 AWS services, including ones like Lambda and API Gateway. The two-hour disruption led to broad app timeouts across customer workloads.</p>
<p>Control-plane network device issues led to major slowdowns in arguably AWS&#x27;s busiest zone, which impacted streaming, e-commerce, and collaboration platforms.</p>
<p>A critical network traffic engineering hiccup led to a relatively brief but comprehensive global breakdown impacting services such as Twitch, Netflix, and Slack.</p>
<p>An Amazon Kinesis meltdown resulted in all-day disruptions ripping across third-party apps and financial websites.</p>

<p>If dropping temperatures and the late-October festivities have you thinking ahead to colder holidays and winter nights to come, you may want to start putting away your summer wardrobe or storing some of your summertime bedding and decor. And when you find yourself running out of space in the closet, kitchen, laundry room, basement, garage, or foyer, what&#x27;s left for storage but under the bed?</p>
<p>Right now, Walmart has a fantastic Flash Deal on a two-pack of Under-Bed Storage Containers with Wheels, which can help you get organized and store your warm-weather clothing safely and out of sight. Normally priced at $63, you can get them for just $30 - or $33 off.</p>
<p>Reviewers call these &quot;great products,&quot; saying they&#x27;re spacious, easy to put together, and sturdily made. They&#x27;ve got wheels on the bottom for easy access, and they&#x27;re plenty versatile, with high-density waterproof materials, but you&#x27;ll want to be careful not to overstuff them. They&#x27;re ideal for excess clothing, unused bedding, plushies, and other soft odds and ends.</p>
<p>&quot;These storage organizers were easy to assemble, and they&#x27;re quite roomy,&quot; said one reviewer. &quot;They&#x27;re as sturdy as I expected, and tucking them under the bed is as nice and easy as can be. I also love that the cover zips on so well, keeping out dust, so that when a blanket or jacket is needed, you can just pull it out and it&#x27;s ready for use.&quot;</p>
<p>Related: Amazon is selling &#x27;spectacular&#x27; noise-canceling headphones for just $70</p>
<p>Measuring about 31 by 17 inches, with a height of 6.7 inches, these sturdy under-bed storage bins sit on a set of smooth-rolling wheels and offer quick, convenient access to the things you may not need all that often but don&#x27;t want to throw out. The covering is fully transparent, so you can see which organizer you&#x27;re after before you open the whole thing up, and the whole bin is dustproof, so your off-season clothing, unused bedding, or collectibles won&#x27;t end up soiled just by sitting under the furniture.</p>
<p>Metal piping lends each container long-term durability, and the lid offers plenty of protection as well, provided you don&#x27;t fill the containers with more than they&#x27;re meant to handle. Each of the four wheels on the underside is on a 360-degree swivel, and two of them are equipped with a handy locking mechanism, in case you want to be sure the bins don&#x27;t go rolling across the room. These are available in both black and gray options, and you&#x27;ll pay the same price no matter which color you choose.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>43-year-old grocery chain to close stores less than a year after opening</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/retail/43-year-old-grocery-chain-to-close-stores-less-than-a-year-after-opening'>Original</a> — 2833 chars</p>
<p>After 43 years since opening its first specialty grocery store in North Carolina, one business has grown into a nationwide chain. But like many retailers navigating today&#x27;s challenging environment, it has not escaped the wave of mass closures affecting the sector.</p>
<p>Less than a year after opening new locations in Naperville, Illinois, and Framingham, Massachusetts, The Fresh Market will soon permanently close both of these locations.</p>
<p>Despite these closures, the grocery chain continues to pursue expansion. The Fresh Market plans to open four new stores, two by the end of 2025 and another two in early 2026, bringing its footprint beyond the 172 stores it currently operates across 22 states.</p>
<p>While simultaneously closing and opening stores may seem contradictory, The Fresh Market sees these moves as part of a strategic reassessment of its store portfolio, aimed at aligning operations with long-term growth goals.</p>
<p>The Naperville store, located at 204 South Route 59, opened in November 2024 as The Fresh Market&#x27;s 164th location. According to a WARN notice, its closure will impact 47 employees.</p>
<p>Once the store shuts down, Illinois will be left with seven locations, but none are nearby. Most in the state are about an hour&#x27;s drive away, and the closest is over 30 minutes by car.</p>
<p>Related: 111-year-old grocery store chain announces major closures in 4 states</p>
<p>The Framingham store at 84 Worcester Road opened a month later, in December 2024, in the former Bed Bath &amp; Beyond space, which closed in 2020 before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2023.</p>
<p>These closures not only reduce The Fresh Market&#x27;s visibility in the affected areas but may also limit choices and access to essential goods for loyal customers, leading them to shop online instead.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation and a growing preference among consumers to shop online to find the cheapest deals took a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers in 2024,&quot; said Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig in a statement.</p>
<p>The Fresh Market&#x27;s closures are part of a larger trend affecting the national retail sector. Amid ongoing economic uncertainty, shifting consumer habits, and trade pressures, many retailers are downsizing or reallocating resources to more profitable areas.</p>
<p>Coresight Research projects that the number of U.S. store closures will reach 15,000 in 2025, more than double the 7,325 closures recorded in 2024.</p>
<p>Even industry giants are following a similar business move by reassessing their footprints and conducting layoffs.</p>
<p>Walmart (WMT) will close a store and pharmacy at 1900 South 314th Street in Federal Way, Washington, on October 31, affecting around 250 employees. Starbucks (SBUX) plans to cut about 900 corporate positions and reduce its North American footprint by roughly 1% in fiscal 2025.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Walmart is selling a &#x27;safe and sturdy&#x27; $200 5-step folding ladder for $93</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/deals/joz-5-step-folding-ladder-walmart-flash-sale'>Original</a> — 2738 chars</p>
<p>TheStreet aims to feature only the best products and services.  If you buy something via one of our links, we may earn a commission.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re the kind of person who doesn&#x27;t call a handyman, plumber, or even contractor at the first sign of trouble in your home, you are probably already armed with a myriad of tools to tackle everything from a dim light to a leaky faucet. One often overlooked essential is a tall, heavy-duty step ladder. However, even the tallest amongst us needs a boost every now and then.</p>
<p>The Joz 5-Step Folding Ladder can hold up to 350 pounds of weight without shaking, and while it normally retails at Walmart for $200, you can shop it for just $93 right now with this limited-time Flash sale. Shoppers love this ladder, calling it &quot;safe and sturdy.&quot;</p>
<p>Ladders, even the really good ones, are always a gamble. And frankly, it&#x27;s easy to feel unsafe on anything but the sturdiest and the best-made models, like this one. Lesser ladders have tiny rungs that couldn&#x27;t support a baby&#x27;s foot, let alone a pair of thick work boots. Each step on this ladder is extra wide, with a non-slip surface so your feet have extra traction to grab onto. There are even handrails to make climbing easier for those with less balance.</p>
<p>&quot;I was concerned about the stability of the legs and feet, but it actually seemed to be more stable than my aluminum ladder,&quot; said one shopper, a 76-year-old woman. &quot;The only downside is it&#x27;s heavier than my aluminum ladder; however, I am still able to carry it around.&quot;</p>
<p>Besides being easier to climb, its non-slip feet provide yet another layer of stability. If you&#x27;re really into home improvement, you&#x27;ll love the versatile tool platform that can easily hold everything from a hammer to a drill or even a bucket of paint. This will save time, energy, and stress from having to climb down the ladder every time you forget something.</p>
<p>Best of all, despite its strength compared to cheap aluminum ladders, it folds up neatly for easy storage. It&#x27;s also fairly lightweight, despite the fact that it&#x27;s heavy-duty. It is resistant to corrosion and waterproof, so you don&#x27;t have to panic if you leave it out in the rain.</p>
<p>While it&#x27;s made for indoor use, you can use it on any stable surface, whether you need to reach into the gutters outside or are using it to prune a small tree.</p>
<p>Related: Amazon is selling a &#x27;sturdy and roomy&#x27; bamboo drawer organizer for just $15</p>
<p>The ladder comes assembled, but if you want the handrails, you&#x27;ll need to attach them yourself. This is easy enough to do, but totally optional.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t settle for weak and wobbly ladders. The versatile and sturdy Joz 5-Step Folding Ladder retails for $200, but you can shop it at Walmart for just $93 with this unbeatable Flash sale.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Key wedding company files Chapter 11 bankruptcy, liquidation likely</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants/wedding-industry-chapter-11-bankruptcy-creates-huge-problems'>Original</a> — 2684 chars</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the nightmare of every bride and groom.</p>
<p>You book a venue for your wedding, rehearsal dinner, or some other marriage-related festivity, and the company goes out of business. That can be a mild problem, like you need a new cake at the last minute, or a major one, like literally not having a place to get married.</p>
<p>This actually happens quite a bit in the wedding business because venues, caterers, bands, and even wedding dresses are purchased so far in advance.</p>
<p>In 2023, for example, when David&#x27;s Bridal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, many brides did not know the fate of their dresses. Had the company ordered them? Would they arrive? And would there be a company location where customers could pick them up?</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s essentially this or nothing,&quot; U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christine Gravelle said when she reluctantly approved the no-cash sale to CION, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>David&#x27;s Bridal was not a unique situation, and now another vital wedding industry brand has closed down without notice, leaving couples unsure of what is happening.</p>
<p>While a rehearsal dinner is not the same as a wedding, couples (or whoever might be footing the bill) pay thousands in deposits many months in advance to secure a location.</p>
<p>Now, &quot;The St. Johns County Sheriff&#x27;s Office has launched an investigation into complaints against Chez L&#x27;Amour restaurant and its owner, Jeanetta Cebollero, after multiple couples reported losing deposits ranging from $2,500 to $3,000,&quot; reported Florida&#x27;s News 4 Jacksonville.</p>
<p>The venue closed abruptly with no explanation and no clear plan for refunds.</p>
<p>A letter obtained by News4JAX from the St. Augustine Law Group, which represents Cebollero, explained some of the problems.</p>
<p>The venue has not filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>If you are planning a wedding, there are steps you can take to protect your investment.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s important to be very meticulous in your recordkeeping.</p>
<p>&quot;Couples should also retain a copy of all promotional items (websites, brochures,  advertisements, etc.), which will help prove the misrepresentations made. Most importantly, all documents showing the financial transactions between the parties (i.e., bank records, receipts, and canceled checks) will be vital to any claim,&quot; the website added.</p>
<p>You can also buy insurance to protect your investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Wedding insurance helps protect your money if something unexpected cancels or changes your wedding plans. It covers things that happen before or on the wedding day that are out of your control. Since weddings can be costly, insurance helps keep your money safe,&quot; Central Bank shared.</p>
<p>The site shared what your policy could cover (but make sure to read it and ask questions).</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Facebook unexpectedly shuts down a major app after five years</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/technology/facebook-unexpectedly-shuts-down-a-major-app-after-five-years'>Original</a> — 2998 chars</p>
<p>Apps have become one of the most convenient ways to instantly access services and simplify everyday tasks, all while obtaining a personalized experience.</p>
<p>However, as efficient as they are, apps can also be costly to maintain, and their profitability doesn&#x27;t always justify ongoing support.</p>
<p>For this reason, Facebook has decided to discontinue one of its most popular apps after five years.</p>
<p>On the day of the official shutdown, users will receive an in-app notification. According to Facebook&#x27;s help tab, Mac users will have 60 days to continue using the Messenger desktop app before it is fully retired. After that, access will be blocked.</p>
<p>Meta encourages users to delete the app once it becomes inactive, since it will no longer be usable.</p>
<p>Once this is done, all chat history will remain accessible online.</p>
<p>The Messenger desktop app version was introduced in 2020, during the height of the Covid pandemic, to give users a more convenient way to stay connected throughout the period of social distancing.</p>
<p>At the time, Meta reported a surge in activity, with total messaging increasing more than 50% in March 2020, while voice and video calls on Messenger and WhatsApp more than doubled, especially in countries most affected by lockdowns.</p>
<p>Related: Spotify adds new messaging feature, letting users slide into DMs</p>
<p>User engagement across Meta&#x27;s platforms, including feeds and stories, also spiked as people sought to stay in touch with loved ones. However, Meta&#x27;s business faced challenges, since many of its services weren&#x27;t directly monetized by higher engagement, and ad revenue declined in regions implementing strict pandemic measures.</p>
<p>Most recently, Meta&#x27;s second-quarter earnings for fiscal 2025 revealed that total revenue increased 22% year over year, daily active users were up 6% to nearly 3.5 billion, and ad impressions rose 9%. Yet expenses also climbed, increasing 12% to $27.1 billion.</p>
<p>One fast-growing area for Meta is Artificial Intelligence (AI). The company recently launched Meta Superintelligence Labs, dedicated to developing advanced models and innovative products such as Llama 4.1 and 4.2.</p>
<p>&quot;Meta&#x27;s vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone - so that people can direct it towards what they value in their own lives. We believe this has the potential to begin an exciting new era of individual empowerment,&quot; said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in an earnings call.</p>
<p>As part of this superintelligence initiative, Meta is focusing on business messaging and AI integration, testing products in some markets that embed AI capabilities into Facebook and Instagram ads, as well as directly into e-commerce platforms.</p>
<p>While shutting down the Messenger desktop app may seem inconvenient, Meta&#x27;s decision could streamline the user experience. By consolidating messaging through the web version, users gain consistent access across desktop devices without needing to download or update separate apps.</p>

<p>Happy Tuesday. This is TheStreet&#x27;s Stock Market Today for Oct. 21, 2025. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.</p>
<p>Silver and Gold had a fantastic Monday, but the buck -- or rather, the metal -- is stopping here.</p>
<p>The falls come after a year-long rally in the metals market, which have seen them outperform many global as investors embrace safe havens.</p>
<p>The U.S. markets are now open, with stocks trading mostly flat. The Dow (+0.09%) and S&amp;P 500 (+0.04%) are up just a few bips, while the Nasdaq (-0.05%) is declining. In small cap land, the Russell 2000 (-0.51%) is pulling back from a nearly 2% run yesterday; Gold is also erasing its fantastical gains from yesterday.</p>
<p>The company said during its Tuesday earnings that its full-year EBIT, adjusted automotive free cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share will come in higher than it forecasted at its last update.</p>
<p>Some of the savings are coming from less-steep tariff exposures, which are now seen costing the firm between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion. That&#x27;s down from $4 billion to $5 billion previously.</p>
<p>Making matters better, GM&#x27;s third quarter vehicle sales rose 8% year-over-year to 710,347; that made it the best-selling brand in America and gave it the best market share relative to the rest of the industry in eight years.</p>
<p>As aforementioned, a number of reports have already happened this morning and elicited reactions from investors. Among them are General Motors (+10.09%) and RTX Corp (+4.8%), as well as PulteGroup (-2.53%) and Northrop Grumman (-2.16%).</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the cropping of some of the largest morning reports sourced from TipRanks, which seem to be coming in mostly in line on revenue, but so-so on EPS earnings:</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also other companies making moves this morning which haven&#x27;t reported, including EPAM Systems (+3.26%) and Newmont Goldcorp (-4.57%). Per data from Investing.com, here are companies which are making big swings ahead of the opening bell today:</p>
<p>Good morning. After a strong start to the week, stocks are flat in futures trading, as a flurry of reports from defense contractors are set to define the morning trade. They won&#x27;t be alone.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what is on deck for today:</p>
<p>Rolling into midweek, data from Nasdaq says there will be 62 earnings reports today, with GE Aerospace, Coca-Cola, and Philip Morris International heading up the morning reports.</p>
<p>This evening, we&#x27;ll also get today&#x27;s biggest report in Netflix, plus some other results from Texas Instruments and Capital One Financial, among others.</p>
<p>This morning, Redbook for Oct. 18 should be out just before 9:00 a.m. ET, at which point the Fed&#x27;s Christopher Waller is expected to give remarks. Later today, at 3:30 p.m. ET, we&#x27;ll also hear from him again.</p>
<p>Aside from the NY Fed&#x27;s 1-2.5 yrs Treasury Purchase report and a refreshed on API Crude Oil Stocks throughout today, those are the largest and most significant economic data reports out today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government enters its 21st day of shutdown. Still, seemingly with no end in sight.</p>

<p>With the high price tag attached to quality furniture these days, when we can get a piece that&#x27;s functional in more ways than one, we&#x27;re quick to snap it up. And nothing&#x27;s quite as versatile or solves space problems more when it comes to overnight guests than a sleeper chair. Designed to function as a space to sit and sleep on, sleeper chairs are one of the few options that truly make sure you get the most for your money, and Walmart has great deals right now on some top picks.</p>
<p>Made with a velvety soft corduroy material, this sleeper chair takes comfort to the max, whether you&#x27;re sitting or lying down on it. This 3-in-1 chair can be set up in folding sofa mode, with that extra layer tucked underneath for elevated support, long sofa mode, and bed mode - meaning you can really customize it to be exactly what you need it to be. Plus, the foldable design makes it easy to seamlessly transform in between the three options. Whether you&#x27;re looking for a space to read a book, rest while watching TV, or get a good night&#x27;s sleep, this convertible chair is a super versatile and affordable option if you need a piece of furniture that does it all.</p>
<p>Filled with shredded foam, the sofa bed is engineered to provide padding and support. It even adapts to your body&#x27;s contours, so you get a customized cushioning that takes pressure off your joints and helps you relax. Although the chair is supportive for the body, because it is more pliable to easily adjust between the three modes, it needs to be used against a wall to get the sturdy support of the headrest/backrest.</p>
<p>Related: Walmart is selling a 22-piece bakeware set for only $25</p>
<p>Because it&#x27;s designed to maximize space in smaller areas, the chair best accommodates one person at a time.</p>
<p>Shoppers say the sofa bed is &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;incredibly comfortable and soft.&quot; They like that it&#x27;s light enough to move easily between rooms, but still heavy enough to stay in place and not wiggle or wobble when someone is using it. The foam provides a very comfortable sitting and sleeping experience, and it&#x27;s perfect for when you need an extra bed for visiting friends and family.</p>

<p>When you&#x27;re working on your feet all day, exploring a new town on vacation, shopping with friends, or running errands, a reliable pair of sneakers can make all the difference. No one wants to end their plans early because of footwear that feels too tight or lacks cushion, but finding the perfect everyday shoe can be time-consuming and tedious, especially if you want something budget-friendly.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve done the legwork and found a highly rated pair of trainers on sale at Nike. The Nike Flex Control 4 Workout Shoes, which are typically priced at $70, are now on sale for 34% off, bringing the total cost down to just $46. These kicks are an excellent choice not just for gym sessions, but all kinds of activities where you want comfort and practicality. As a bonus, you can even select from black or white shoe styles, both available for less than $50 right now.</p>
<p>Nike is renowned for quality footwear that&#x27;s fashionable and supportive, and these workout shoes are no different. With a focus on comfort, these sneakers are lightweight and flexible. Breathable mesh is used on the upper to keep your feet comfortable, even during sweaty workouts. Mesh is great for ventilation, but the woven texture can sometimes be susceptible to wear and tear. However, these practical shoes use an abrasion-resistant material to help your pair last longer.</p>
<p>From leisurely walks to fast feet workout drills, these sneakers keep you sturdy and stable throughout the day. The shoe&#x27;s midfoot strap provides increased stability and support even when engaging in side-to-side motions. Adding deep grooves to the soles, the shoe design makes movement feel natural and unencumbered.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>This might be the worst dividend ETF in the world</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/investing/this-might-be-the-worst-dividend-etf-in-the-world'>Original</a> — 4011 chars</p>
<p>Traditional dividend ETFs are designed to offer stability, regular income and long-term capital growth. Even the ones that push the limits of good faith in what it means to be a dividend ETF at least bear some resemblance to one.</p>
<p>But one ETF is the worst representation of a dividend ETF that I&#x27;ve seen.</p>
<p>While the fund&#x27;s objective says that it &quot;aims to maximize yield per unit of active risk,&quot; there&#x27;s no way that this ETF in practice could even charitably be described as a dividend strategy. It has so few guardrails on what it&#x27;s allowed to do and is clearly taking advantage of it.</p>
<p>On the surface, returns look good, the Morningstar rating is solid and it has a razor-thin expense ratio. All hallmarks of what you&#x27;d look for in a good fund.</p>
<p>Look under the hood, however, at how the sausage is made and you&#x27;ll find something ugly.</p>
<p>The fund I&#x27;m talking about is the Franklin U.S. Core Dividend Tilt Index ETF (UDIV). It tracks the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Enhanced Select Index, which is designed to deliver a portfolio of stocks with a higher dividend yield than the broader market.</p>
<p>According to Morningstar, the index is constructed using an optimization framework that aims to maximize dividend yield, improve diversification, mitigate active risk, and simplify replication.</p>
<p>Related: 3 High-Yield Vanguard Dividend ETFs for Retirement</p>
<p>That all sounds well and good. In practice, however, it&#x27;s not.</p>
<p>The methodology used by UDIV essentially boils down to this:  as long as the final portfolio produces an above average yield, anything goes. There&#x27;s no quality check. No emphasis on fundamentals. No yield requirement. No baseline dividend history. The constituents of the portfolio don&#x27;t even need to pay a dividend.</p>
<p>The end result is a portfolio that looks anything but like a dividend ETF.</p>
<p>One needs to look no further than the composition of UDIV to see how absurd it is.</p>
<p>The nearly 37% allocation to tech stocks is higher than even that of the S&amp;P 500, which is as concentrated as it&#x27;s ever been in tech stocks. The rest of the sector holdings are mostly within about 2% one way or the other of the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>But even that&#x27;s not the most egregious thing about UDIV. Check out the fund&#x27;s top 10 holdings.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s count all of the ways that UDIV&#x27;s claim of being a dividend ETF is a joke.</p>
<p>Does that sound like any kind of a dividend ETF to you?</p>
<p>Almost anything qualifies as a &quot;better&quot; dividend ETF alternative to UDIV, but here are a few that I feel are constructed the right way.</p>
<p>Setting aside its miserable recent performance, this is one of the best constructed portfolios in terms of pure dividend stock exposure.</p>
<p>It incorporates screens for dividend quality, dividend growth and high yield. It also focuses on fundamentals and optimizes the portfolio to only include those stocks with the best combination of all criteria. Its 4% yield will also please income seekers.</p>
<p>DGRW looks for companies with forward-looking dividend growth potential, not just dividend history. It considers balance sheet fundamentals, including return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) as part of its selection process.</p>
<p>It also weights the portfolio by aggregate dividends paid. That means those companies paying out the most get greater weights in the portfolio.</p>
<p>SDY is perhaps the best combination of high yield and long-term dividend growth. The fund includes only those companies with a 20+ year track record of dividend growth, but then weighs qualifying components by their dividend yield.</p>
<p>The result is a fund that pays a modestly high yield but has a composition far different than that of the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>UDIV is a mega-cap growth fund with a heavy tech tilt above all else. The dividend component is only a minor consideration.</p>
<p>If you want tech exposure like this, just invest in a tech ETF. If you want a dividend ETF, go with one that actually considers dividend growth or quality as part of its selection criteria.</p>

<p>TheStreet aims to feature only the best products and services.  If you buy something via one of our links, we may earn a commission.</p>
<p>Patio furniture is a far more personal purchase than one might initially think. How you choose to configure your home&#x27;s outdoor space is a reflection of your personality and dictates the types of experiences you wish to have there. Whether you want a sprawling sectional and seat combo for crowded get-togethers or a simple bistro set for you and your partner, there&#x27;s no better place to buy than Walmart. It has one of the largest selections of patio sets anywhere on the internet, and we found a rocking chair patio set that&#x27;s currently on sale there for an amazing price.</p>
<p>This is anything but the average patio set. It includes two comfy rocking chairs and a small bistro table. The chairs have high backs and hollow-grid rattan wicker construction. The chairs and table are made from all-weather powder-coated stainless steel. That makes them both lightweight and incredibly sturdy. The entire set can be exposed to the elements year-round with very little fading or deterioration. This set is definitely built to outlast many similar sets in the same price range.</p>
<p>The table, though small, is quite impressive in its own right. The entire table is composed of stainless steel, but also has a small rattan shelf midway down the legs. This allows for additional storage of electronic devices, books, or anything else you may wish to keep close-at-hand. The chairs have a seating dimension of 23.8  inches long by 34.8 inches wide. The chairs have a weight capacity of 250 pounds each.</p>
<p>The rockers on each chair give you the perfect amount of motion without feeling unstable. What&#x27;s more, they have anti-tip foot pads on each rocker, which keeps the chairs from going too far forward or too far back at any given time. The set is available in both a light and a dark colorway, making it a great choice for almost any outdoor decor style.</p>

<p>Walmart shoppers were very impressed with this beautiful furniture. One called it &quot;a great looking set,&quot; before adding that the chairs are &quot;comfortable and sturdy. The rocker is very smooth.&quot;</p>
<p>If you want a patio set that will change the entire look and feel of your backyard, then you should consider buying the Lausaint Home 3-Piece Rocking Chair Patio Set. You can get it at the moment for only $60, so it&#x27;s better to put one in your cart sooner rather than later. This deal could disappear any minute now.</p>

<p>Although we&#x27;re not always 100% sold on all the electronic upgrades and updates hitting the market at what feels like a constant rate, smartwatches are an accessory we can fully get behind. There&#x27;s something to be said about not always needing some piece of high-tech equipment when you&#x27;re simply running errands or working out, but smartwatches make it easier than ever to pay attention to your health without lugging around a heavy phone or iPad. And though some can cost a pretty penny, you can find the perfect smartwatch for you at our favorite retailers that does everything for a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>This affordable smartwatch gives you the capabilities of a phone right at your wrist. Designed to be compatible with both Android and iOS devices, this 1.85 inch touchscreen can access texts, make calls, track steps, play music and games, and track weather. With texts, it&#x27;s important to note that while it can receive and access them, it cannot send replies. It also acts as a camera, noise detector, stopwatch timer, language assistant, calculator, flashlight, alarm clock, and calendar. The smartwatch is also equipped with multiple sports modes and fitness trackers, so you can track your workouts including running, cycling, or playing basketball. It can track calories burned, steps and strides, and heart rate. There&#x27;s also a sedentary reminder that prompts you to get moving if you stay dormant for too long.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s just where the features begin. You don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping the watch dry when you&#x27;re working up a sweat. The watch has an IP68 waterproof rating, which not only means the device is dust-tight, but that it&#x27;s also capable of withstanding prolonged water exposure and immersion beyond one meter. Sizewise, the watch fits comfortably on men and women with wrist sizes ranging from 5.4 inches to 8.6 inches. On a full charge, the lithium battery-powered watch has up to 240 hours or between 10-20 days of battery life for moderate use, and 1-10 days with frequent use. With the watch, you get two interchangeable straps: one Milan steel and one silicone, the latter of which is great for when you&#x27;re being active.</p>

<p>Shoppers love the cost effectiveness of the watch. They say the battery life is &quot;incredible&quot; and that it&#x27;s often mistaken for more expensive options on the market due to its sleek, high-quality design. One shopper even says that she seems to get better sound quality through her watch than her iPhone.</p>
<p>A smartwatch certainly isn&#x27;t an essential, but when you can access everything you need to simply with a glance of your wrist, why not invest in your own? Get the Mingdaln Waterproof Smartwatch for 85% before other shoppers snatch up the amazing deal.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Tesla shareholders respond to latest push against Elon Musk</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/automotive/tesla-shareholders-respond-to-latest-push-against-elon-musk'>Original</a> — 3355 chars</p>
<p>On Oct. 17, proxy advisor firm Institutional Shareholder Services urged shareholders to vote &quot;no&quot; on the pay package, potentially be worth $1 trillion, that Tesla TSLA has proposed for CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p>On Monday, Oct. 20, fellow advisory firm Glass Lewis &amp; Co. followed suit, urging Tesla stockholders to reject the proposal.</p>
<p>Glass Lewis says the pay plan warrants &quot;significant concern&quot; due to the potential dilution of shareholder power, according to Bloomberg, which viewed the report.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ISS said it had &quot;unmitigated concerns&quot; about the proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;While it is recognized that the board seeks to retain Musk due to his track record and vision for Tesla&#x27;s future, and further that some shareholders may support this award in light of Musk&#x27;s successes in achieving growth of the company, there are unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award&#x27;s magnitude and design,&quot; ISS said in a recent note.</p>
<p>On Oct. 20, Tesla responded to Glass Lewis.</p>
<p>Concern about Musk&#x27;s compensation isn&#x27;t anything new for ISS, Glass Lewis, or Tesla.</p>
<p>The pair have consistently warned against giving Musk too much control of the company, but Tesla points out that he has rewarded shareholders&#x27; faith in him so far.</p>
<p>Tesla called the Glass Lewis and ISS notes &quot;misguided&quot; and reminded shareholders that &quot;these firms do not own Tesla - you do.&quot;</p>
<p>On X (formerly Twitter), Tesla posted:</p>
<p>Shareholders have spoken twice on Elon&#x27;s 2018 CEO Performance Award. ISS&#x27;s and Glass Lewis&#x27;s recommendations attempt to override the mandate our shareholders delivered to Elon and ignore the staggering financial results delivered under Elon&#x27;s leadership.</p>
<p>Like ISS, Glass Lewis also recommended that shareholders vote against longtime Musk confidant Ira Ehrenpreis retaining his independent director board seat. Ehrenpreis joined the board in May 2007 and is its longest-serving member.</p>
<p>Unlike ISS, Glass Lewis also said shareholders should vote against Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, another Musk confidant who has been a member of Tesla&#x27;s board since December 2018.</p>
<p>&quot;Kathleen has been a part of two of the most transparent governance processes in modern day corporate America and brings decades of legal, operating, compensation, human capital and management expertise critical to winning the AI talent war,&quot; Tesla said on X.</p>
<p>To keep Tesla CEO Elon Musk happy, the company needs to pay him a lot more money and give him much more power.</p>
<p>Last month, Tesla awarded Elon Musk a new pay package that is worth about $29 billion now, subject to shareholder approval. However, the package will be worth much more than that if Tesla reaches the valuation it says it can.</p>
<p>Related: Tesla urges investors to ignore trillion dollar warning from influential firm</p>
<p>Shareholders are set to vote on the proposal at the company&#x27;s annual meeting on November 6.</p>
<p>Tesla says shareholders should vote &quot;yes&quot; on all the company&#x27;s proposals, but one expert says they should think twice about giving Musk all of that power.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Musk too distracted by SpaceX, xAI, and everything else to give Tesla his full focus? That&#x27;s a fair question... and exactly why strong, independent board oversight matters,&quot; Dominick Miserandino of Retail Tech Media Nexus said.</p>
<p>&quot;Free markets don&#x27;t mean free passes; accountability and transparency still count.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the hardest parts of getting new furniture isn&#x27;t just the time it takes to pick the right one to begin with. The real tricky part can be putting the pieces together. Rather than hiring someone to do it for you, you can save your money and invest it in another home upgrade when you opt for furniture that requires little to no assembly. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new sectional, you&#x27;re in luck, because we&#x27;ve been spotting them left and right, and many don&#x27;t require assembly at all.</p>
<p>The Fvbeaya Cloud Sectional Sofa is one of our latest Walmart finds that takes comfortable and convenient seating to the next level. Not only is it modular and easy to put together, but it&#x27;s also on sale. Thanks to  a Flash deal, you can get the $600 sectional sofa for just $387.</p>
<p>Combining style, comfort, and versatility, this cloud sectional sofa has everything you could possibly want in living room seating. It has a modular design with clean lines and thick armrests, and since it&#x27;s in two pieces, its configuration options are almost endless, too. You can set it up as an L-shaped sectional, move the pieces together to create a large bed, separate them to create dueling loveseats, or arrange them so you have a seating area with cozy and defined spaces.</p>
<p>Related: Walmart is selling a tall storage cabinet for $60 that&#x27;s &#x27;perfect for small spaces&#x27;</p>
<p>The sectional features deep, 27.1-inch seats and a chaise with a depth of 59.8 inches, both of which you can easily cozy up in to relax or take an afternoon nap. And with high-resilience memory foam throughout, you may never want to get up, as shoppers say it&#x27;s incredibly comfortable. The sectional is upholstered in &quot;plush and cozy&quot; corduroy fabric that&#x27;s breathable and soft with texture that gives it an extra luxurious look and feel. Not to mention, the cover is removable, so it&#x27;s easy to wash and clean.</p>
<p>Best of all, this sectional is completely assembly-free. Since it doesn&#x27;t have a wooden frame and only consists of two pieces, all you have to do is unpack each piece. Then, give it 72 hours to fully expand, and your new favorite piece of furniture will be ready to lounge on.</p>
<p>Walmart shoppers raved about this cloud couch, saying it&#x27;s &quot;super comfortable and soft.&quot; Reviewers shared that it&#x27;s great for relaxing, whether you want to read a book, watch a movie, or play a video game. One customer said it&#x27;s been a great addition to their living room, since it&#x27;s both comfortable and stylish.</p>
<p>The Fvbeaya Cloud Sectional Couch is on sale for just $387, which isn&#x27;t a deal you see often when it comes to sectional sofas. However, as a Flash deal, it won&#x27;t be discounted for long. Shop it while you can, and you&#x27;ll be on your way to cloud-like luxury in no time.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Las Vegas Strip resort venue files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/retail/las-vegas-strip-casino-venue-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy'>Original</a> — 3390 chars</p>
<p>Bankruptcy filings are not a common occurrence among Las Vegas Strip casinos and businesses.</p>
<p>The last significant bankruptcy on the Strip was over 10 years ago in January 2015 when Caesars Entertainment, then-owned by Apollo Global Management and TPG Capital, filed for Chapter 11 to eliminate about $16 billion in debt.</p>
<p>Chinese-themed Lucky Dragon Casino, which opened in Las Vegas in 2016, filed for bankruptcy and closed down in 2018.</p>
<p>Las Vegas-based privately held casino operator Maverick Gaming LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 14, 2025, a month after S&amp;P Global Ratings withdrew all of its ratings on the company.</p>
<p>Maverick Gaming owned four Northern Nevada casinos located in Elko and Wendover, Nev., 17 cardrooms in Washington state, and three casinos in Colorado when it filed for bankruptcy. Its casino holdings included 2,500 slot machines, 320 table games, 1,200 hotel rooms, and 30 restaurants.</p>
<p>While no casinos on the Strip  have filed for bankruptcy in many years, a business located in a casino resort venue has filed a Chapter 11 petition.</p>
<p>Image source: The Colosseum at Caesars Palace</p>
<p>Electric Playhouse, the Las Vegas Strip&#x27;s unique adult interactive social gaming venue, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize its business.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque-based parent company filed its petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada on Oct. 20, listing $1 million to $10 million in assets and liabilities, according to RK Consultants.</p>
<p>Electric Playhouse NV LLC did not state a reason for filing for bankruptcy in its petition.</p>
<p>The high-tech entertainment venue opened its first interactive location in Albuquerque in 2021.</p>
<p>The 10,000 square-foot entertanment venue opened inside The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace Las Vegas on the Terrace Level on the Strip on June 22, 2024, offering dozens of motion-activated games and experiences, where players&#x27; bodies become the game controllers, without the need of headsets and gadgets.</p>
<p>The venue is equipped with a network of sensors that generate a real-time point cloud, enabling precise tracking of individuals and large groups throughout the facility, according a statement on the Electric Playhouse website.</p>
<p>The volumetric data is used to create a digital twin of each guest, similar to a player inside a video game. As guests move, the walls, floors and tables react to their actions in a variety of ways, enhanced by 360-degree projection mapping that fully immerses guests in interactive games and dining experiences.</p>
<p>The venue also has an outdoor patio with views of the Strip and a bar and restaurant, Electric Elixirs, which offers a dining menu, including chicken wings and tenders, wraps, salads, bowls, either personal pizza or slices, and pastries or Dubai chocolate bar for dessert.</p>
<p>&quot;In a world where passively sitting in front of screens with video games, smartphones, VR and TV is all too common, Electric Playhouse provides an active, social and energetic entertainment alternative,&quot; Electric Playhouse CEO and co-founder Brandon Garrett said in a statement when the venue opened.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to re-energize the way people of all ages interact with technology by inviting them into an experiential world where they can connect, play and create lasting memories together,&quot; Garrett said.</p>

<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/daily-market-wrap-top-stocks-apple-netflix-and-coreweave'>Original</a> — 4023 chars</p>
<p>The Amazon Web Services outage disrupted work during the Monday morning rush hour, but it did little to dampen Wall Street&#x27;s momentum. The market surged across the board, led by strong gains in Apple and optimism ahead of a heavy earnings week.</p>
<p>Optimism about artificial industry and the potential for a government reopening contributed to a bullish market as we enter the 20th day of shutdown.</p>
<p>Market veteran Dan Niles, Founder of Niles Investment Management, said on X.</p>
<p>&quot;While I believe the market is suffering from &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; given current valuations, I believe it can extend even further fueled by easy money, strong Q3 earnings and AI optimism.&quot;</p>
<p>Niles added, &quot;The goal is to catch as much of this inflating AI bubble as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors are also eyeing a key CPI report, which is needed for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and potentially influences what&#x27;s next for Fed interest rate cuts, even as most government operations remain stalled.</p>
<p>Image Source: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</p>
<p>Apple&#x27;s stock was up 4.5% on Monday owing to optimistic iPhone sales. Netflix stock was trading 3.5% higher ahead of its Q3 report on Oct. 21. CoreWeave, an up-and-coming cloud infrastructure provider, suffered, with its stock down 7%.</p>
<p>Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah upgraded Apple to Buy from Hold with a price target of $315 from $226, citing &quot;material upside&quot; to iPhone shipment estimates through 2027.</p>
<p>The firm&#x27;s supply chain checks suggest that Apple could be entering a multi-year iPhone refresh and design cycle that may deliver three consecutive record years of shipments.</p>
<p>Everscore ISI also added Apple to the firm&#x27;s &quot;Tactical Outperform List&quot;, maintaining Outperform rating and a $290 price target. The firm pointed to stronger-than-expected iPhone demand and higher lead times than the prior model, as reported by TheFly.</p>
<p>Wedbush reiterated an Outperform rating and a price target of $1,500 on the stock, saying that research indicates strong subscriber retention and acceptance of recent price increases.</p>
<p>The firm noted that advertising revenue could become Netflix&#x27;s primary growth driver by 2026, fueled by live event programming, better ad targeting and broader ad partnerships.</p>
<p>In a surprise collaboration, AMC Entertainment (AMC) announced that it will screen Netflix&#x27;s most-watched film, KPop Demon Hunters, across 400 theatres in the US and Europe starting Halloween weekend.</p>
<p>Related: Netflix makes a major move to win over subscribers</p>
<p>AMC CEO Adam Aron posted to X, &quot;Netflix, the world&#x27;s largest streaming service, and AMC Entertainment, the world&#x27;s largest theatre chain, have jointly decided to work together. This new cooperation will start this Halloween weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>Aron said that the partnership opens &quot;mutually beneficial opportunities&quot; between the two companies, hinting at further cooperation ahead.</p>
<p>Investment firm Two Seas Capital, one of Core Scientific&#x27;s largest shareholders, urged investors to vote against the merger, arguing that CoreWeave&#x27;s attempt to acquire Core Scientific substantially undervalues the company &quot;at a time of unprecedented value creation across the sector.&quot;</p>
<p>Related: CoreWeave&#x27;s $5 billion gamble hits a wall</p>
<p>The firm believes Core Scientific could achieve greater returns as an independent company.</p>
<p>CoreWeave considers the acquisition pivotal to cementing its position as a force in the AI cloud infrastructure space.</p>
<p>Additionally, CoreWeave announced the appointment of Jon Jones as its first Chief Revenue Officer. Jones, a former Amazon executive, is expected to spearhead global expansion as the company scales its AI-focused cloud infrastructure business.</p>
<p>Michael Intrator, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of CoreWeave, said of Jones&#x27; appointment,</p>
<p>&quot;The scale of AI adoption demands entirely new products and services, and with Jon Jones on board, we are well-positioned to extend our leadership as the platform of choice for AI innovation and adoption.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>More police agencies adopt AI, raising efficiency — and concern</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/technology/more-police-agencies-adopt-ai-raising-efficiency-and-concern'>Original</a> — 3858 chars</p>
<p>The legendary TV detective, portrayed by Jack Webb in the long-running show &quot;Dragnet,&quot; who famously wanted just the facts, would be shocked to see the impact artificial intelligence is having on modern-day crimefighting.</p>
<p>Police departments have been making use of such innovations as predictive policing, where AI algorithms analyze large datasets, like historical crime data, social-media activity and environmental factors, to predict where and when crimes are likely to occur.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also facial recognition technology and biometrics - both of which have sparked controversy.</p>
<p>Related: Biometrics prompts praise and concerns as more companies adopt the science</p>
<p>&quot;Reporting is a critical component of good police work; however, it has become a significant part of the job that officers commonly refer to as &#x27;burdensome,&#x27; &quot; the Scottsdale, Ariz., company says, noting that every week officers in the U.S. can spend up to 40% of their time - or 15 hours of a 40-hour week - on what is essentially data entry.</p>
<p>Axon said that agency trials have resulted in roughly one hour of time saved per day on paperwork. For every eight officers who use Draft One during their workdays, that translates to an extra eight-hour shift or more, the company added.</p>
<p>&quot;Draft One remains our fastest-adopted software solution,&quot; Axon Founder and Chief Executive Rick Smith told analysts during the company&#x27;s second-quarter earnings call in August.</p>
<p>&quot;When customers start to use a product like Draft One for 60 days [they] say, &#x27;man, I&#x27;m spending a full day more every week on the road fighting crime as opposed to sitting behind a computer,&quot; Chief Operating Officer Josh Isner said. &quot;Those are the kinds of stories that just build.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was a little bit skeptical; I&#x27;m not a big technology person,&quot; Brittingham said in a March interview at the Fort Collins police station for CNN&#x27;s Terms of Service podcast.</p>
<p>But spending less time writing reports means Brittingham can &quot;take more calls for service&quot; and &quot;be proactive in preventing crime,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Axon declined to say how many departments currently use Draft One, but police have also adopted it in Lafayette, Ind.; Tampa, Fla.; and Campbell, Calif.</p>
<p>Police departments in Minnesota are increasingly using artificial intelligence to write police reports, KSTP reported earlier this month.</p>
<p>Draft One uses Generative AI &quot;and includes a range of critical safeguards, requiring every report to be reviewed and approved by a human officer, ensuring accuracy and accountability of the information before reports are submitted,&quot; Axon says.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the technology has raised concerns. Both California and Utah have laws that require disclosure when artificial intelligence is used to generate police reports.</p>
<p>A study by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said its investigation found that Draft One &quot;seems deliberately designed to avoid audits that could provide any accountability to the public.&quot;</p>
<p>The foundation said that Draft One uses a ChatGPT variant to process body-worn camera audio of public encounters and create police reports based only on the captured verbal dialogue. It does not process the video.</p>
<p>&quot;The Draft One-generated text is sprinkled with bracketed placeholders that officers are encouraged to add additional observations or information - or can be quickly deleted,&quot; the group said, adding that the product offers &quot;meager oversight features that deliberately conceal how it is used.&quot;</p>
<p>Related: R&amp;D spending now can have big payoffs later for companies</p>
<p>&quot;Draft One was designed to mirror the existing police narrative process - where, as has long been standard, only the final, approved report is saved and discoverable, not the interim edits, additions, or deletions made during officer or supervisor review.&quot;</p>

<p>There may not be any snow on the ground just yet, but it&#x27;s pretty chilly where I&#x27;m sitting. Winter and the holiday season will be here before we know it, and that makes it a good time to prepare for cold air, snowy sidewalks, icy roads, and all that other fun stuff. Wintertime is beautiful, but you don&#x27;t want to get caught out in the chill wind or crunchy snow without layers, boots, and something to keep your head warm.</p>
<p>Whether you&#x27;re shopping for your winter wardrobe or buying a gift for someone you care about, Walmart has a fantastic Flash Deal on a pair of bestselling Ecetana Snow Boots at the moment. Normally priced at $50, you can get a new pair for just $30. That&#x27;s a savings of $20.</p>
<p>Reviewers love Ecetana&#x27;s fur-lined snow boots for their excellent traction, long-term warmth, stylish looks, waterproofing, comfortable fit, and lightweight feel. They&#x27;re easy to slip on and off, but more than one shopper says you may want to order half a size up, if possible, to account for the fleece lining and fuzzy collar. What socks you wear with them will also likely help you decide which size to go with; there&#x27;s currently no size 10.5 or 12.5 option, for example. One shopper called them &quot;really well made and very stylish,&quot; saying they&#x27;re &quot;well worth the price.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;re super warm,&quot; another reviewer said. &quot;The entire interior is fleece-lined and so warm, and once laced up they add a lot of support around the ankles. There&#x27;s also some height to the soles, so they&#x27;ll be able to handle low snow without any concerns of snow getting into the boot. The bottoms have good grip as well. Great boots for the price!&quot;</p>

<p>You&#x27;ll be ready for whatever winter brings when you&#x27;ve got a pair of warm, non-slip snow boots as your shield against the elements. These boots feature a sturdy water-resistant faux-leather upper, a fuzzy fleece lining and collar, and rubber outsoles, with a classic lace-up closure, for a modern design that keeps to what works. Walmart sells them in sizes ranging from a men&#x27;s 6 to a size 13, with a few half-size increments available. You can get them in black or khaki, and any size or color you go with should come at the same great discount price.</p>
<p>Deep treads ensure a stable, surefooted grip when you&#x27;re out crossing a patch of ice, shoveling walks, crossing the parking lot to get to your car, or braving the downtown shopping area to pick up those prized holiday gifts this year. You&#x27;ll have plenty of room for your foot, a snug fit around the ankle, and all the warmth and comfort winter&#x27;s bite calls for.</p>

<p>As colorful leaves pile high in your yard and temperatures begin to drop, you may find yourself reaching for that favorite hoodie or jacket when you go out to ward off the chill. But when you&#x27;re relaxing at home on the couch, you probably want to wrap up in something cozy before you dive into your next book or Netflix binge. You want the kind of blanket that&#x27;s not too lightweight and not too heavy at this time of year - basically, the perfect transition throw.</p>
<p>Enter the Amelie Faux Fur Throw, which is on sale at Amazon right now for just $30. It normally retails for $70, but you can save $40 on the Textured Orange Brown color if it happens to jive with your aesthetic (and since it&#x27;s the quintessential fall shade, we&#x27;re feeling it all the way).</p>
<p>The Amelie Faux Fur throw measures 60 by 80 inches, which technically means it would fit a twin bed perfectly. But it&#x27;s also large enough to cover you and a companion, either of the two- or four-legged variety. It&#x27;s super soft and feels like real fur, and is also Oeko-Tex certified, so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin types.</p>
<p>While the $30 deal applies to the 60 by 80 size and Textured Orange Brown color only, this blanket does come in other sizes (55 by 70 inches and 88 by 90 inches) and 18 other shades. The prices range from $26 to $53, depending on what option you go for. But when it comes to the best deal of them all, our pick is the way to go.</p>
<p>Caring for this throw is also simple. When it&#x27;s in need of a wash, you can just toss it in the machine and use the gentle cycle with cold water, easy as that. While you can dry it on high heat, we recommend a few cycles on low for the best results. It is worth noting that the throw comes vacuum-sealed and will expand to its full size after it&#x27;s been opened.</p>
<p>Related: Amazon is selling $140 electric heated socks for $61 that are &#x27;comfy and super warm&#x27;</p>
<p>More than 200 shoppers have given this blanket a 5-star rating, highlighting everything from its weight to its ease of care. One shopper calls it &quot;exceptionally well made&quot; and mentions it does not shed, while another calls it &quot;gorgeous,&quot; saying, &quot;This is the nicest throw/blanket I have purchased. I have three others. Very soft and fairly heavy.&quot;</p>
<p>With chilly weather either already here or right around the corner, depending on where you live, it&#x27;s the perfect time to invest in a blanket that will carry you through the fall and winter months. The Amelie Faux Fur Throw from Amazon is a simply fantastic pick, and at only $30, it&#x27;s a total steal. Grab one now and prepare to spend the next few months in cozy luxury.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Disney World replaces iconic restaurant with chicken nugget, burger eatery</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/travel/disney-world-closes-beloved-eatery-as-part-of-a-major-transformation'>Original</a> — 4267 chars</p>
<p>Walt Disney World is closing one of its most distinctive quick-service eateries - but it&#x27;s already planning a major comfort food comeback.</p>
<p>As of October 20, 2025, Harambe Market, located in the Africa section of Animal Kingdom, has officially shut down for refurbishment and will reopen in early 2026 as a hamburger and chicken nuggets restaurant, according to a DisneyByMark report.</p>
<p>For nearly a decade, Harambe Market was celebrated for its African-inspired street food, from grilled meats and rice bowls to plant-based dishes that reflected the details of a bustling East African marketplace.</p>
<p>The open-air food court, set against themed façades of realistic-looking market stalls,  drew praise for its authenticity and atmosphere rather than typical theme park fare.</p>
<p>That era, however, appears to be coming to a close.</p>
<p>The updated Harambe Market will take over as the new home base for crowd-pleasing staples currently served at Restaurantosaurus in DinoLand U.S.A., which will close permanently in February 2026 as part of the land&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Tropical Americas&quot; transformation.</p>
<p>This change is part of a park-wide dining reshuffle accompanying the permanent closure of Trilo-Bites and Dino-Bite Snacks, two longtime snack counters in DinoLand U.S.A. Known for their ice cream, Dole Whip floats, and Buffalo Chicken Chips, both stands are now closed.</p>
<p>Related: Disney World begins demolishing iconic attraction</p>
<p>The crowd-favorite chips will move to Eight Spoon Café on Discovery Island, while various floats will be served at Warung Outpost in Asia. Hand-scooped ice cream, meanwhile, is not expected to return to Animal Kingdom until early 2026.​</p>
<p>During the interim construction period, Disney announced that Kusafiri Coffee Shop &amp; Bakery in the same Harambe area will offer expanded lunch options. These include rice bowls, wraps, and plant-based meals to fill the gap while Harambe Market undergoes renovation.​</p>
<p>The closure of Harambe Market also ties directly into the much larger overhaul of Animal Kingdom&#x27;s DinoLand U.S.A., set to become a Tropical Americas land inspired by Central and South American landscapes and cultures.</p>
<p>The new land will reportedly introduce attractions themed to &quot;Encanto&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones,&quot; marking one of the park&#x27;s most ambitious reimaginings since &quot;Pandora: The World of Avatar&quot; debuted in 2017. With Restaurantosaurus, Trilo-Bites, and Dino-Bite Snacks disappearing, Disney appears to be consolidating its quick-service food infrastructure to serve especially busy park zones.​</p>
<p>Work could conclude by late spring 2026. However, Disney insiders indicate that the popular dining area is expected to reopen months earlier - i.e., in time for President&#x27;s Day crowds in February and well ahead of spring break crowds.​</p>
<p>TheStreet reached out to Disney for comment on the timeline but had not received a response at the time of publishing.</p>
<p>Some longtime visitors are sure to be disappointed by the loss of African street eats, but the decision seems to stem from on logistics and guest volume.</p>
<p>Burgers and nuggets remain some of Disney&#x27;s top-selling dishes across its parks, and moving Restaurantosaurus&#x27; menu to Harambe Market ensures that Animal Kingdom retains a high-capacity quick-service dining option while construction reshapes DinoLand.</p>
<p>At a May media conference, Chairman of Disney Experiences Josh D&#x27;Amaro explained how updates like these reflect a larger strategy across Disney&#x27;s parks. D&#x27;Amaro&#x27;s comments, as reported by DisneyFoodBlog, point to the company&#x27;s dining refreshes, which aim to make menus approachable while aligning park zones with broader storytelling themes.</p>
<p>There is &quot;literally nothing like it in the world. We&#x27;re always making sure that we&#x27;re delivering value to every one of our guests that comes into one of our experiences or theme parks,&quot; D&#x27;Amaro said.</p>
<p>As Animal Kingdom transitions toward the new &quot;Tropical Americas&quot; land, the changes at Harambe Market&#x27;s show how food service is an integral part of any Disney theme park transformation.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Backers of bankrupt airline shut down in Chapter 11 arrested for fraud</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/travel/backers-of-bankrupt-airline-shut-down-in-chapter-11-arrested-for-fraud'>Original</a> — 3238 chars</p>
<p>Among more than a dozen smaller regional airlines that went bankrupt over the last two years is the Australian low-cost carrier Bonza.</p>
<p>Launched in 2021 in the country&#x27;s Sunshine Coast, it was envisioned with the goal of serving an undertapped market of travelers flying from or into the region north of Brisbane in Queensland, as well as to other rural and regional cities too small to be served by larger airlines.</p>
<p>While over 650,000 travelers booked and flew on Bonza within the first year of it starting service in 2023, the airline entered voluntary administration, the Australian equivalent of Chapter 11 proceedings, in April 2024 while also terminating all of its employees and canceling dozens of flights across Australia.</p>
<p>The airline was placed in liquidation by a judge after failing to find a buyer by July of the same year. The bankruptcy came after Miami-based 777 Partners, the investment firm financing the airline&#x27;s launch, started running into financial problems of its own and stopped supplying it with funds.</p>
<p>In a development last week, the FBI charged 777 Partners Co-founder Joshua Wander and Chief Financial Officer Damien Alfalla with fraud of over $500 million. Alfalla pled guilty to participation and is cooperating with the investigation into his former partner.</p>
<p>According to the charges filed in the Southern District of New York by attorney Jay Clayton, Wander used his role at the company &quot;to cheat private lenders and investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars by pledging assets that his firm did not own, falsifying bank statements, and making other material misrepresentations about 777&#x27;s financial condition.&quot;</p>
<p>Related: A camper company is stepping in to help travelers stranded by airline bankruptcy</p>
<p>Homeland Security Special Agent Ricky J. Patel described both Wander and Alfalla as promoting &quot;an illusion of stability&quot; when in fact the airline was &quot;a years-long house of cards&quot; in which both investors and beneficiaries like Bonza were misled about its financial state.</p>
<p>The company also invested in Canadian airline Flair Airlines.</p>
<p>&quot;This alleged scheme was self-serving, siphoning funds meant for victims and leaving investors and lenders holding the bag,&quot; Patel wrote further.</p>
<p>Earlier reports claimed that Wadner specifically targeted &quot;new sectors with less certain cash-flow profiles, including streaming platforms, airlines, and professional sports teams such as Sevilla FC and Genoa CFC.&quot;</p>
<p>The specific charges against Wadner include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and securities fraud and together, carry maximum charges of 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Australia&#x27;s corporate regulator had earlier this year shared that it would not prosecute Bonza&#x27;s own board of directors over the sudden shutdown, as members were largely unaware of the lacking funds until creditors started coming after assets.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Bonza staff were also left unpaid when the airline suddenly shut down in April 2024.</p>
<p>&quot;We started to hear the whispers and probably could see the writing on the wall, but we kept working hard all the way until the final curtain,&quot; pilot Paul McKeown told national broadcaster ABC News at the time.</p>

<p>Can anyone argue about how essential pantry storage is for any kitchen? Before the refrigerator, this is where singles and families alike would go when it was time to prep a meal, using shelf-stable essentials like pasta, rice, and flour to make breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the occasional snack. With modern tech, there&#x27;s another place in your kitchen that could easily double as a second pantry: your freezer. Sure, your fridge keeps food fresher longer, but the freezer can keep things from spoiling for months, if not years.</p>
<p>Everyone can use extra freezer space, whether you want to stock up for the winter or be able to jump on discounted meat and ice cream without having it spoil on you before you get to it. No matter how small your kitchen is, you&#x27;ll likely be able to fit in the $230 Auseo Mini Freezer Chest, which is on sale at Walmart for just $160.</p>
<p>Adding extra freezer space to your kitchen is like buying a cordless vacuum cleaner: you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever lived without it. There&#x27;s a reason a lot of modern refrigerators provide more and more freezer space. Having access to frozen food, be it everyday staples or leftovers that you stored for a rainy day, is one of those quality-of-life improvements that pays off in dividends for years to come. Shoppers are calling this small freezer &quot;deep and spacious&quot; and love how it tucks away into even tiny kitchens.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the perfect size for my apartment and holds enough food for me for a few weeks,&quot; one shopper said. This 31.8-inch-tall chest holds up to 2.7 cubic feet of storage space for seasonal fruit, meat, ready-made dinners, and snacks like mozzarella sticks and potato skins that may not fit in your already cramped freezer.</p>
<p>There are two removable baskets that make filling and emptying the freezer easier, but you could easily slide them out for even more storage space. It provides a temperature range of anywhere from -11 to -50 degrees Fahrenheit, which you can modify using a simple dial. It&#x27;s even got an easy drainage port when you need to run a defrosting cycle.</p>
<p>Related: Walmart is selling a $339 cordless stick vacuum that &#x27;lasts longer&#x27; than name brands for only $55</p>
<p>When buying a large kitchen appliance - even one with such a low profile - it&#x27;s key that you ensure that you have the space for it before purchasing. More importantly, you should also check that there&#x27;s a three-pronged outlet nearby.</p>
<p>KitchenAid mixers and Vitamix blenders may be coveted, but they don&#x27;t provide what a chest freezer does, which is freedom. Having extra freezer space means you&#x27;ll always have all your favorites on hand when dinner time rolls around, no matter how stuffed your refrigerator is. The Auseo Mini Freezer is an excellent addition to your kitchen, especially at Walmart&#x27;s discounted price of just $160.</p>

<p>Frozen waffles, toaster pastries, bagels, toast, and English muffins aren&#x27;t just delicious breakfast fare; they can also be quickly prepared in the toaster. For decades, using a toaster has meant guesswork that oftentimes results in undercooked or badly burnt outcomes. Modern touchscreen toasters have improved this experience in recent years so that you can perfectly prepare morning meals each and every time.</p>
<p>Since digital toasters are more high-tech than the traditional version, they usually cost quite a bit more. Walmart is now making it more affordable to invest in one of these innovative items with a limited-time flash deal on the Whallultra 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster. Normally retailing for $160, this convenient kitchen appliance has been massively marked down by 69%, which brings the total to just $50. If you want something even more affordable, the two-slice model is also on sale for just $38 with a 68% discount.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;ve never had the chance to try out a touchscreen toaster for yourself, you&#x27;ll be amazed by the intelligent interface and seamless user experience. To get the perfect toastiness, the screen has six bread types to choose from, including regular bread, bagels, gluten-free bread, English muffins, waffles, and pastries. Next, you&#x27;ll choose from six shade settings, starting with barely toasted and reaching a darkness that&#x27;s just shy of burnt. You can further customize this electronic toaster&#x27;s settings if your food is frozen or only needs reheating. Once the toasting begins, a countdown timer starts to let you know the exact time it will take to pop up.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s not just the intelligent features that make this smart toaster so incredible. As one shopper describes, it &quot;looks sleek, is easy to use, and toasts like a champ.&quot; The modern, yet timeless design uses long-lasting stainless steel that will look great on any kitchen countertop.</p>
<p>Since it&#x27;s equipped with oversized slots, measuring 1.5 inches wide, this toaster won&#x27;t smoosh thick bagels and breads. Plus, clean-up is made easy with a removable crumb tray. On top of that, the right and left sides work independently, so you can make toast for yourself and Pop-Tarts for your children simultaneously, even if they need different settings.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive things about this smart toaster, outside of the quality construction and impressive functions, is the rave reviews. With an average customer rating of 4.7 out of five stars, this kitchen appliance has been given perfect five-star reviews from more than 1,300 shoppers. &quot;It&#x27;s perfect for busy mornings,&quot; said one reviewer. They added that the toaster&#x27;s &quot;compact size and stainless steel finish add a modern touch.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>American airline brings back very long flight to New Zealand</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/travel/american-airline-brings-back-very-long-flight-to-new-zealand'>Original</a> — 3056 chars</p>
<p>Over 6,500 miles from the West Coast of the U.S. in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, the small island nation of New Zealand is seen by many as a dream holiday destination.</p>
<p>The main airlines providing service from the U.S. are flag carrier Air New Zealand and United Airlines and American Airlines from cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, and Dallas.</p>
<p>The 8,813-mile and nearly 18-hour Air New Zealand flight between Auckland and New York takes its spot along the longest in the world.</p>
<p>Since acquiring Hawaiian Airlines in September 2024 in a deal worth approximately $2 billion, Seattle-based Alaska Airlines has kept the airline operating under the same brand and with much of its original network.</p>
<p>This week, the parent company shared that it will bring back a seasonal flight between Honolulu&#x27;s Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL) and Auckland Airport (AKL) that Hawaiian first launched in 2013.</p>
<p>Related: One country is set to take tourist taxes to a whole new level</p>
<p>Taking just under eight hours and 30 minutes to reach New Zealand, the flight will run on an Airbus A330 plane with 18 of the 278 passenger seats lie-flat business and 68 premium economy known on the airline as Extra Comfort.</p>
<p>Designed as a seasonal flight during the months when New Zealanders like to travel during time off and Americans like to visit New Zealand when it&#x27;s warmest and most verdant, the flight will launch on Nov. 16 and run until April 2026.</p>
<p>The flight to New Zealand will run three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays to depart at 1:15 p.m. local time and arrive at 9:20 p.m. the next day.</p>
<p>The flight back to Honolulu will, in turn, depart on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. New Zealand time to arrive at 9:20 a.m. the following day.</p>
<p>&quot;Our seasonal flights operate during the Southern Hemisphere summer, when New Zealand comes alive with warm weather and blooming nature - ideal for exploring vineyard havens like Marlborough and Hawkes Bay or tackling any of the country&#x27;s 11 iconic Great Walks - while also providing ample connectivity throughout the busy holiday season,&quot; the airline wrote of the route.</p>
<p>In acquiring Hawaiian Airlines, Alaska Airlines aimed to grow and cement its network of flying to non-mainland states as well as eventually expand its presence to more international destinations.</p>
<p>Earlier last summer, the airline announced flights from Seattle to the United Kingdom and Iceland that it is set to start running in May 2026.</p>
<p>&quot;We know Kiwi travelers have long awaited the return of our seasonal service, and our crews are thrilled to welcome them onboard once again [...],&quot; Andrew Stanbury, regional director for the South Pacific for Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, said in a statement on the route.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, thanks to the strength of our combined global network, every guest flying from Hawai&#x27;i, the U.S. mainland, and New Zealand will have more options than ever to explore the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Home organization gets tricky when you run out of floor space for extra cabinets and dressers to store your things. One vital piece of real estate you may be overlooking is your home&#x27;s doors. If you need extra storage in your kitchen, a hanging organizer on your pantry door works wonders. In bedrooms, you can utilize your closet doors. Pretty much any room with a door will do the trick, but to really maximize vertical storage in your home, you need over-the-door storage with spacious pockets that won&#x27;t buckle under the weight of heavier items.</p>
<p>Right now, you can snag the Torio Over-The-Door Organizer for just $20 at Walmart. This hanging organizer&#x27;s heavy-duty design has five large pockets and 10 smaller side pockets that allow you to organize your things effortlessly. Typically priced at $28, this handy storage solution is available at a 29% discount for a limited time.</p>
<p>Many hanging organizers tend to lose shape when you fill the pockets, but this one is specifically designed to hold nearly 50 pounds without warping. Each of the five large pockets features a transparent front panel allowing you to easily see what&#x27;s stored inside with just a glance. On either side of each of the five tiers is a mesh pocket that&#x27;s ideal for organizing smaller items so they don&#x27;t get buried deep in a drawer or at the back of a cabinet shelf where you can&#x27;t see them.</p>
<p>Between each of the five tiers, there&#x27;s 11 inches of clearance so that you can store taller items. For reference, a 20-ounce soda bottle is about 9 inches tall and could be easily stored in this hanging organizer. Even when all the pockets are full, three reinforced steel hooks keep this organizer firmly in place, so you shouldn&#x27;t experience any sliding or slipping when you open and close the door.</p>

<p>Shoppers are impressed by the durability of this hanging storage solution because it can hold heavier items than similarly designed organizers. One shopper shared that this &quot;very sturdy&quot; organizer is a lifesaver in their kitchen. &quot;I use it for my pantry over the door, and I put bagged beans and my boxes of plastic bags... just all sorts of things that were crowding up my pantry.&quot;</p>
<p>Another reviewer said that &quot;the pockets are roomy,&quot; adding that they can store tall hair spray cans in their bathroom without the pockets tipping over.

<div class='article'><h2>American Airlines makes key beverage change</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/travel/american-airlines-makes-key-beverage-change'>Original</a> — 4812 chars</p>
<p>Flying can be uncomfortable for many people. In fact, estimates suggest that up to 40% of U.S. adults have some fear of flying, and a report from March 2025 showcases that this year&#x27;s flying incidents have made 65% of passengers more nervous about air travel.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s not just about the fear of flying, or more precisely, the fear of crashing. There are many other factors that can make air travel uncomfortable for passengers.</p>
<p>I, for example, love traveling and love flying, but during my last flight, I had an undetected sinus infection, which resulted in a very uncomfortable flight and feeling unwell for several days after. Now, I am not so happy about the idea of taking another flight.</p>
<p>Airlines know this. They also know that packing requirements, long lines, security checks, crowds, and delays make people nervous and frustrated. That&#x27;s why the majority of airlines are constantly coming up with innovative ways to make their service exceptional so that passengers feel comfortable during the flights.</p>
<p>The competition in the aviation industry is aggressive, and major carriers are working hard to deliver superior service, improved convenience, and a touch of luxury.</p>
<p>American Airlines shared on October 16 that it has teamed up with Lavazza coffee, a globally recognized Italian brand known for its premium blends.</p>
<p>Starting in early 2026, American Airlines will serve Lavazza across all cabins in flight and at American Flagship and Admirals Club lounges. This is the first time the carrier will offer a consistent coffee experience both on the ground and in the air, writes Ben Schlappig for One Mile at a Time.</p>
<p>&quot;At American, we&#x27;re focused on looking at every aspect of the customer experience, and a quality cup of coffee is an important part of that journey. We&#x27;re proud to team up with this iconic brand to bring a rich, satisfying coffee experience to our customers - whether they&#x27;re in the air or relaxing in our lounges,&quot;  stated American Airlines Chief Customer Officer Heather Garboden.</p>
<p>Lavazza, founded in 1895 in Turin by Luigi Lavazza, is a family-owned brand with a history of crafting exceptional coffee for over a century. It began as a small grocery-store operation.</p>
<p>Over the last 130 years, Lavazza has been at the forefront of coffee craftsmanship; its premium blends are served in top restaurants and hotels around the world.</p>
<p>After all, from 2004 to 2024, the number of American adults who have had coffee in the past day increased by 37%, reaching the highest level in more than 20 years, according to a report by the National Coffee Association.</p>
<p>Related: United Airlines adds game-changing perk to win over customers</p>
<p>Despite coffee&#x27;s popularity, it is not the most commonly consumed beverage on flights. According to Thrillist, most commonly ordered drinks on flights are Coca-Cola and Pepsi.</p>
<p>Still, offering first-class coffee on flights is an important part of the overall experience, and its impact shouldn&#x27;t be overlooked. In a recent interview with Reuters, Air Canada VP of Loyalty and Product Scott O&#x27;Leary said:</p>
<p>&quot;Food and beverage just tend to have a disproportionate impact on customer satisfaction, more than any other attribute of our products and services.&quot;</p>
<p>O&#x27;Leary had spoken following Air Canada&#x27;s recent upgrade: adding free beer and wine for all passengers.</p>
<p>They are betting on customer loyalty through premium experience.</p>
<p>Bernstein analyst David Vernon said that although it is &quot;slightly counterintuitive to the consolidation narrative,&quot; he said, &quot;airline competition is alive and well.&quot;</p>
<p>American Airlines recently made several important changes and upgrades.</p>
<p>In September, the carrier partnered with Porter Airlines on a new codeshare relationship, providing passengers with more traveling options between the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Since September 29, travelers have been able to book codeshare itineraries for flights on aa.com or American&#x27;s mobile app, as well as onflyporter.com. Under the partnership, American will place its code on select flights run by Porter from Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ).</p>
<p>AAadvantage members booking a codeshare flight operated by Porter earn both AAdvantage miles and loyalty points.</p>
<p>American Airlines also announced a prestigious Champagne partnership with Bollinger, the iconic family-owned brand, both on the ground and in the air.</p>
<p>More recently, the carrier made a controversial boarding policy change that sparked a debate. American Airlines removed metal bag sizers, which were used to check whether carry-on luggage fit its size limits, from all boarding gates across the country.</p>
<p>Some passengers view the sizer as more objective than relying on an agent&#x27;s discretion, making the change controversial.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Apple’s iPhone 17 story just took an unexpected turn</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/technology/apples-iphone-17-story-just-took-an-unexpected-turn'>Original</a> — 3801 chars</p>
<p>A lot has been made of Apple&#x27;s push into AI, wearables, and services, but it&#x27;s the iPhone that remains the heartbeat of the company&#x27;s business.</p>
<p>Its ubiquitous smartphone still generates more than 50% of its $390 billion in annual sales. When iPhone demand jumps, everything else follows, including margins, free cash flow, and the buyback engine that has effectively propped up its unmatched trillion-dollar market cap.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s exactly what the iPhone 17 launch carried, so much more weight than a typical refresh.</p>
<p>Following a few years of relatively sluggish upgrades, Apple needs a cycle that shifts the slope of its powerful growth curve. The 17 series comes with sharper cameras, brighter displays, improved battery life, and the kind of polish that nudges longtime users to trade up.</p>
<p>However, this isn&#x27;t just a feature cycle, but more of a market test. In the U.S., trade-in programs and carrier subsidies have helped offset stretched budgets. In China, new rebates are aiming to blunt domestic competition.</p>
<p>Having said that, a brand new iPhone 17 sales report just revealed whether this launch lived up to the lofty expectations. Is a genuine super-cycle coming, or is this just another solid quarter dressed up as one?</p>
<p>Image source: Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p>
<p>Apple may have finally found its spark.</p>
<p>According to reporting from the Financial Times citing Visible Alpha data, the redesigned iPhone 17 is fueling the company&#x27;s strongest smartphone growth since the pandemic. Carrier data and supply-chain checks underscore the stronger-than-expected demand since its popular September launch.</p>
<p>Related: Why Nvidia&#x27;s Vera Rubin may unleash another AI wave</p>
<p>That level of optimism has brightened market sentiment heading into the holiday quarter, despite AI delays and renewed U.S.-China tariff risks. For perspective, the stock is up over 28% in the past six months alone, and almost 6% this month.</p>
<p>After two years of flat or dropping iPhone sales, camera, display, and battery upgrades continue driving an upgrade cycle, which analysts say feels much broader than the last one.</p>
<p>Deepwater Asset Management commented that the extended waits point to a deeper replacement wave. According to Gene Munster, &quot;It&#x27;s fair to describe the iPhone 17 launch as surprising versus where Wall Street expectations were at the end of August.&quot;</p>
<p>The recent momentum has Apple&#x27;s supply partners running hot, with IDC data showing &quot;much stronger&quot; early iPhone 17 orders compared with the previous model. The company will detail the results when it reports fiscal Q4 earnings on Oct. 30.</p>
<p>Unit volumes are likely to hover near 235 million through 2026 before blowing past the 240 million mark in 2027, boosted by a rumored foldable iPhone. For now, the 17&#x27;s steady pricing and global trade-in deals seem to be doing the job,  giving Apple a rare stretch of potential upside.</p>
<p>Apple is expected to report its fiscal Q4 2025 results on Thursday, Oct. 30, after the close.</p>
<p>Wall Street consensus expectations point to an EPS between $1.74 and $1.76 on $100 to $102 billion in sales. Analysts expect mostly flat-to-slight margin improvement, as services growth helps offset hardware-related costs.</p>
<p>Related: Bank of America quietly echoes Warren Buffett&#x27;s favorite strategy</p>
<p>Back in July, Apple&#x27;s management estimated mid-to high-single-digit revenue expansion, a gross margin of 46% to 47% (including nearly $1.1 billion in tariff costs), along with operating expenses near $15.6 to $15.8 billion.</p>
<p>Those numbers effectively set the benchmark heading into the print, with attention on whether margins can hold up into the final quarter of the year. Early data on the iPhone 17 is stronger than expected, but Q4 results will offer more concrete evidence.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Bank of America resets inflation prediction ahead of CPI</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/fed/bank-of-america-resets-inflation-prediction-ahead-of-cpi'>Original</a> — 4582 chars</p>
<p>Wall Street and Main Street are wringing their hands over the next inflation update from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Oct. 24. The BLS&#x27;s monthly Consumer Price Index is a major inflation measure that could sway the likelihood that the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates when it meets on Oct. 29.</p>
<p>The last CPI data from August weren&#x27;t overly reassuring. It showed headline inflation increased to 2.9%, due mainly to recently instituted tariffs. For comparison, the CPI reading in April, before most of President Trump&#x27;s tariffs went into effect, showed inflation of 2.3%.</p>
<p>The September CPI print is particularly anticipated because its release was delayed due to the government shutdown. So it lands just ahead of the Fed&#x27;s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, providing one of the last bits of information that could determine whether Fed officials think inflation is getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Ahead of the CPI report, Wall Street firms, including Bank of America, are updating their inflation predictions.</p>
<p>The Fed&#x27;s monetary policy decisions are governed by a dual mandate to maintain low unemployment and inflation.</p>
<p>Image source: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those two goals are often at odds, and that&#x27;s especially true in 2025.</p>
<p>When the Fed raises interest rates (as it did in 2022 and 2023), inflation falls but unemployment rises. Lowering the Federal Funds Rate has the opposite effect.</p>
<p>That dynamic led Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to delay rate cuts over concern that they would fuel inflationary fires as tariffs increased costs to businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>The Fed&#x27;s inflation target is 2%, so the increase since spring has pressured the central bank toward patience. That hesitancy has increased the possibility that the Fed has fallen behind the curve when it comes to lowering rates to prop up the economy and support the jobs market.</p>
<p>If inflation continues to climb further above the Fed&#x27;s inflation target, Powell and company could find themselves boxed into a corner, once again hesitant to cut interest rates further over fears of sending inflation skyrocketing as it did in 2022. At that time Consumer Price Index inflation exceeded 8% before retreating due to stiff rate hikes.</p>
<p>Bank of America&#x27;s latest number crunching suggests that prices likely moved up again in September, but only slightly.</p>
<p>Digging deeper into the numbers, Bank of America sees core goods prices up 0.1% from August, a &quot;moderation from the trailing three-month average.&quot; However, it thinks that moderation stems from a drop in used-car prices. Excluding that factor, it says &quot;core goods prices likely rose by 0.2% [month over month,] in line with the last two months.&quot;</p>
<p>The investment firm&#x27;s economists also see core services inflation up 0.3% during the month, a &quot;slight moderation from the 0.4% m/m prints in each of the last two months.&quot; However, they view that level as &quot;still too firm for comfort.&quot;</p>
<p>We continue to expect tariffs to remain a source of goods price inflation over the next few quarters.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Bank of America says the impact of tariffs on inflation isn&#x27;t yet over.</p>
<p>In the absence of the BLS&#x27;s jobs data, the Fed will likely rely on other measures to see if its quarter-percentage-point cut in September is helping.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, data from private-payroll processor ADP paint an ugly picture. ADP says the U.S. economy lost 32,000 jobs in September, far shy of the job gains economists expected.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that there&#x27;s been a steady drumbeat of layoffs this year. According to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, U.S. employers have announced 946,426 layoffs this year through September. That&#x27;s the most since 2020 and up 55% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Jobs data from Bank of America released earlier this month further muddy the waters. An analysis of payroll and unemployment checks flowing into its customers&#x27; accounts suggests that the jobs market weakened again last month. In a separate report, Bank of America also highlighted a dropoff in hiring activity at small businesses.</p>
<p>The cracks in the employment market suggest that the Fed doesn&#x27;t have much choice but to keep lowering rates to support the economy. So if Bank of America is correct that headline CPI only inches up, it&#x27;s unlikely to pour cold water on another quarter-point cut at the meeting later this month.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not think the report will be a game changer for the Fed. We expect&quot; a 25-basis-point cut in October, concludes Bank of America&#x27;s analysts.</p>

<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/technology/elon-musk-takes-shot-at-a-rival-that-just-made-a-huge-mistake'>Original</a> — 2522 chars</p>
<p>Amazon has grown since it launched as an online bookstore in 1995 to become the dominant player in web hosting 30 years later.</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) was launched in 2006, and over the last decade, it has become the largest cloud computing provider in the world.</p>
<p>AWS generated $107.6 billion in revenue for Amazon in 2024, a 19% increase from the previous year. While that is only a fraction of the $670 billion the company brought in, AWS is so popular and cost-effective that it accounts for over 50% of Amazon&#x27;s yearly profits.</p>
<p>Netflix, Adobe, Apple, Capital One, Disney, and BMW all use AWS computing power to run their online presences. NASA, GE, Pfizer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson do as well.</p>
<p>So when users started reporting outages early the morning of Oct. 20, there was no telling how big the problem was.</p>
<p>Early on Oct. 20, a notice on the AWS status page said that it was experiencing DNS, or Domain Name System, issues with its database service, DynamoDB, which underpins many of its other applications.</p>
<p>DNS allows web browsers to find websites by translating their names into IP addresses.</p>
<p>Related: Jeff Bezos has hard-nosed take on work-life balance</p>
<p>The first outage was reported at 12:11 a.m. PDT in AWS&#x27; US-East-1 region hosted in northern Virginia. By 3:35 a.m. PDT, AWS said the issue had been fully mitigated and that operations were back to normal.</p>
<p>But the company has continued fixing the issue all morning, while providing numerous updates.</p>
<p>According to the outage detection and reporting website Downdetector, several high-profile clients were affected.</p>
<p>Users on Downdetector showed some concern about the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it comes back up. We need AWS to run our weekly payroll later today,&quot; user Matthew Fierro wrote.</p>
<p>Thousands of people commented on X, formerly Twitter, but one high-profile user took the opportunity to kick Amazon while it was down.</p>
<p>Ever the gamesman, self-proclaimed online troll Elon Musk on Oct. 20 took a shot at AWS on X.</p>
<p>&quot;Messages on X chat are fully encrpyted with no advertising hooks or strange &#x27;AWS dependencies,&#x27; so I can&#x27;t read your messages even if someone put a gun to my head,&quot; Musk said. &quot;You can do file transfers and audio/video calls.&quot;</p>
<p>While AWS was down, he made sure to note that &quot;X works.&quot;</p>
<p>The outage didn&#x27;t just affect websites in the U.S. AWS is a global company, and in the UK, banking giant Lloyds and telecom service providers Vodafone and BT reported issues as well.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Wrecking ball hits popular nightclub after Chapter 11 bankruptcy</h2>
<p><a href='https://www.thestreet.com/travel/wrecking-ball-hits-popular-nightclub-after-chapter-11-bankruptcy'>Original</a> — 2896 chars</p>
<p>Along with the high-profile bankruptcies of airlines like Spirit and tour operators such as MixxTravel, the last few months also brought with them a number of real estate failures.</p>
<p>In September, the hotel company behind five properties in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami suddenly filed for Chapter 11 protection. Guests who arrived at hotels like The Tuscany and Hotel 27 in Manhattan discovered that no staff were available to check them in and had to find accommodation at last-minute prices of over $1,000 per night.</p>
<p>Over in the Brooklyn borough, the Brooklyn Mirage open-air nightclub that opened in 2017 is facing an even worse fate after the limited-liability company that owns it filed for bankruptcy last August.</p>
<p>As first spotted by the Real Deal, the nightclub that was once a symbol of East Williamsburg&#x27;s potential was not permitted to operate last summer after failing to meet a timeline for an annual inspection deadline.</p>
<p>Now, parent company Avant Gardner filed for a demolition permit with New York&#x27;s Department of Buildings (DOB) to tear down the 32,000-square-foot space at an estimated cost of more than $1.5 million after running up debts north of $155 million over the last few years.</p>
<p>Related: Popular hotel chain files Chapter 11 bankruptcy, guests stranded</p>
<p>&quot;DOB had numerous objections to the performance space, both safety related and technical in nature, that prevented the project from being code-compliant and safe enough to open for the public,&quot; the agency&#x27;s spokesperson said to local news outlet The Brooklyn Paper. &quot;This wasn&#x27;t a question of red tape, but rather a list of legitimate issues with the constructed space.&quot;</p>
<p>The nightclub&#x27;s reputational challenges began after two separate guests were found dead in a nearby creek within several weeks of each other in 2023 and then another patron death occurred in 2024.</p>
<p>Amid challenges attracting guests, the nightclub began running up major debts and soon found itself unable to meet its obligations to creditors.</p>
<p>Avant Gardner fired the Brooklyn Mirage&#x27;s CEO Josh Wyatt in May 2025, and a few weeks later, new chief executive Gary Richards was overheard complaining about how hard it is to sell the company at three-star Michelin restaurant Per Se.</p>
<p>In the years immediately after opening, the nightclub hosted a number of high-profile names including Drake, David Guetta, and Tiësto. DJ Magazine also named it as being among the country&#x27;s top 100 nightclubs at the start of 2023.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision to file for Chapter 11 relief follows several months of financial distress, culminating with Avant Gardner being unable to open its newly constructed Mirage event space for the 2025 season,&quot; the company said in a statement back in August, while posting on social media that it was still aiming to &quot;bring the Mirage back for 2026 and beyond.&quot;</p>
