<p>Ig Nobel-winning research could one day be used to treat people with blocked airways or clogged lungs.</p>
<p>Last year, a group of researchers won the 2024 Ig Nobel Prize in Physiology for discovering that many mammals are capable of breathing through their anus. But as with many Ig Nobel awards, there is a serious side to the seeming silliness. The same group has conducted a new study on the feasibility of adapting this method to treat people with blocked airways or clogged lungs, with promising results that bring rectal oxygen delivery one step closer to medical reality.</p>
<p>As previously reported, this is perhaps one of the more unusual research developments to come out of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated shortages of ventilators and artificial lungs to assist patients&#x27; breathing and prevent respiratory failure. The Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital Medical Center team took their inspiration from the humble loach, a freshwater bottom-dwelling fish found throughout Eurasia and northern Africa. The loach (along with sea cucumbers) employs intestinal breathing (i.e., through the anus) rather than gills to survive under hypoxic conditions, thanks to having lots of capillary vessels in its intestine. The technical term is enteral ventilation via anus (EVA).</p>
<p>Would such a novel breathing method work in mammals? The team thought it might be possible and undertook experiments with mice and micro-pigs to test that hypothesis. They drew upon earlier research by Leland Clark, also of Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital, who invented a perfluorocarbon liquid called Oxycyte as a possible form of artificial blood. That vision never materialized, although it did provide a handy plot point for the 1989 film The Abyss, in which a rat is able to &quot;breathe&quot; in a similar liquid.</p>
<p>And Oxycyte was ideal for the group&#x27;s 2021 Ig Nobel-winning efforts. The experiments involved intra-anally administering oxygen gas or a liquid oxygenated perfluorocarbon to the unfortunate rodents and porcines. Yes, they gave the animals enemas. They then induced respiratory failure and evaluated the effectiveness of the intra-anal treatment. The result: Both treatments were pretty darned effective at staving off respiratory failure with no major complications.</p>
<p>Credit: Cincinnati Children&#x27;s/Med</p>
<p>So far, so good. The next logical step was to determine if EVA could work in human patients, too. &quot;Patients with severe respiratory failure often need mechanical ventilation to survive, but these therapies can cause further lung injury,&quot; the authors wrote in this latest paper. EVA &quot;could give the lungs a chance to rest and heal.&quot;</p>
<p>The team recruited 27 healthy adult men in Japan, each of whom received a dose of non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin via the anus. They were asked to retain the liquid for a full hour as the dosage slowly increased from 25 to 1,500 mL. Twenty of the men successfully completed the experiment. Apart from mild temporary abdominal bloating and discomfort-which proved to be dosage dependent and resolved with no need for medical attention-they experienced no adverse effects.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first human data and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,&quot; said co-author Takanori Takebe of Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital and the University of Osaka in Japan. &quot;But now that we have established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Even with protections, wolves still fear humans</h2>
<p><em>Ars Science - <a href='https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/even-with-protections-wolves-still-fear-humans/'>Original</a></em></p>

<p>European wolves flee human conversation faster than dogs&#x27; barking.</p>
<p>In May 2025, the European Parliament changed the status of wolves in the EU from &quot;strictly protected&quot; to &quot;protected,&quot; which opened the way for its member states to allow hunting under certain conditions, such as protecting livestock. One of the arguments behind this change was that the &quot;tolerance of modern society towards wolves&quot; led to the emergence of &quot;fearless wolves&quot; that are no longer afraid of people.</p>
<p>&quot;Regulators made it clear, though, that there is no scientific evidence to back this up,&quot; says Michael Clinchy, a zoologist at Western University in London, Canada. &quot;So we did the first-of-its-kind study to find out if wolves have really lost their fear of humans. We proved there is no such thing as a fearless wolf.&quot;</p>
<p>The big bad wolf trope is found in plenty of our myths and fables, with Little Red Riding Hood being probably the most famous example. This mythical fear of wolves, combined with real damage to livestock, led to extensive hunting. By the mid-20th century, we&#x27;d pushed wolves to the verge of extinction in Western and Central Europe. Human-wolf encounters became very rare, and the big bad wolf myth faded away. But starting in the 1970s, wolves became a protected species across Europe and North America, which caused wolf populations to bounce back and reoccupy some of their old habitats.</p>
<p>Zanette and Clinchy did their study in the Tuchola Forest, one of the largest Central European forests located in northern Poland. After the Polish wolf protection laws had come into force back in the 1990s, the first wolves were sighted there in 2005, and the first breeding was confirmed in 2013. Today, there are over 15 different wolf packs living in the Tuchola Forest, and the total number of wolves in Poland reached around 4,300 individuals in 2022.</p>
<p>This quickly became an issue, at least for some people. Mieczysław Kacprzak, an MP from Poland&#x27;s PSL Party, currently in the ruling coalition, addressed the parliament in December 2017, saying that wolves were roaming suburban roads and streets, terrorizing citizens-in his view, a tragedy waiting to happen. He also said children were afraid to go to school because of wolves and asked for support from the Ministry of Agriculture, which could lift the ban on hunting. An article in &quot;Łowczy Polski,&quot; a journal of the Polish hunting community with a title that translates as &quot;The Polish Huntsman,&quot; later backed these pro-hunting arguments, claiming wolves were a threat to humans, especially children.</p>
<p>The idea was that wolves, in the absence of hunting, ceased to perceive humans as a threat and felt encouraged to approach them. But it was an idea that was largely supported by anecdote. &quot;We found this was not the case,&quot; says Liana Zanette, a biologist at Western University and co-author of the study.</p>
<p>To figure out if wolves really were no longer afraid of humans, Zanette, Clinchy, and their colleagues set up 24 camera traps in the Tuchola Forest. &quot;Our Polish colleagues and co-authors, especially Maciej Szewczyk, helped us set those traps in places where we were most likely to find wolves,&quot; Zanette says. &quot;Maciej was literally saying &#x27;pick this tree,&#x27; or &#x27;this crossroads.&#x27;&quot; When sensors in the traps detected an animal nearby, the system took a photo and played one of three sounds, chosen at random.</p>
<p>The first sound was chirping birds, which the team used as a control. &quot;We chose birds because this is a typical part of forest soundscape and we assumed wolves would not find this threatening,&quot; Clinchy says. The next sound was barking dogs. The team picked this one because a dog is another large carnivore living in the same ecosystem, so it was expected to scare wolves. The third sound was just people talking calmly in Polish. Zanette, Clinchy, and their colleagues quantified the level of fear each sound caused in wolves by measuring how quickly they vacated the area upon hearing it.</p>
<p>When the results were in, the team counted over a hundred wolves caught by the traps. The ones that heard the birds from the speakers appeared a bit startled but generally remained calm. Hearing the dogs, on the other hand, usually made them move away somewhat hurriedly. But the wolves feared people the most. Compared to the control sound of birds, hearing people was twice as likely to make wolves run, and it made them run twice as fast. Comparison to dogs also ended up in our favor: The wolves found humans roughly 20 percent more threatening. The same pattern held true for deer and wild boars, typical prey of wolves, which also got caught in the camera traps.</p>
<p>&quot;These results track with basically the same experiment we did in Africa, where we tested the entire savannah mammal community,&quot; Clinchy says. In that work, Clinchy and Zanette found that leopards, hyenas, and many other animals feared humans more than lions. &quot;You know, a lion is the apex predator, and yet pretty much everything across the board was twice as afraid of u</p>

<div class='article'><h2>NSO permanently barred from targeting WhatsApp users with Pegasus spyware</h2>
<p><em>Ars Technology Lab - <a href='https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/nso-permanently-barred-from-targeting-whatsapp-users-with-pegasus-spyware/'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_176106a6a87c.jpg'></p>
<p>Ruling holds that defeating end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp harms Meta&#x27;s business.</p>
<p>A federal judge has ordered spyware maker NSO to stop using its Pegasus app to target or infect users of WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The ruling, issued Friday by Phyllis J. Hamilton of the US District Court of the District of Northern California, grants a permanent injunction sought by WhatsApp owner Meta in a case it brought against NSO in 2019. The lawsuit alleged that Meta caught NSO trying to surreptitiously infect about 1,400 mobile phones-many belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials-with Pegasus. As part of the campaign, NSO created fake WhatsApp accounts and targeted Meta infrastructure. The suit sought monetary awards and an injunction against the practice.</p>
<p>Friday&#x27;s ruling ordered NSO to permanently cease targeting WhatsApp users, attempting to infect their devices, or intercepting WhatsApp messages, which are end-to-end encrypted using the open source Signal Protocol. Hamilton also ruled that NSO must delete any data it obtained when targeting the WhatsApp users.</p>
<p>NSO had argued that such a ruling would &quot;force NSO out of business,&quot; as Pegasus is its &quot;flagship product.&quot; Hamilton ruled that the harm Pegasus posed to Meta outweighed any such considerations.</p>
<p>&quot;In the court&#x27;s view, any business that deals with users&#x27; personal information, and that invests resources into ways to encrypt that personal information, is harmed by the unauthorized access of that personal information-and it is more than just a reputational harm, it&#x27;s a business harm,&quot; Hamilton wrote. &quot;Essentially, part of what companies such as Whatsapp are &#x27;selling&#x27; is informational privacy, and any unauthorized access is an interference with that sale. Defendants&#x27; conduct serves to defeat one of the purposes of the service being offered by plaintiffs, which constitutes direct harm.&quot;</p>
<p>The judge went on to deny Meta&#x27;s request that the injunction bar foreign governments that may use WhatsApp. She said that sovereign governments weren&#x27;t parties to the lawsuit. Friday&#x27;s ruling also denied Meta&#x27;s request that the injunction bar NSO from targeting users of other Meta properties such as Facebook and Instagram on the grounds there was no evidence presented concerning targeting of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#x27;s ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again,&quot; WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said in a statement. &quot;We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society. It sets an important precedent that there are serious consequences to attacking an American company.&quot;</p>
<p>Hamilton also slashed the punitive damages a jury awarded to Meta from $167 million to $4 million. The judge said the standard the jury based the amount on wasn&#x27;t proper. Under the correct standard, punitive damages must be capped at $4 million, she said.</p>
<p>We welcome the court&#x27;s decision to accept NSO&#x27;s position and to drastically reduce the punitive damages by more than 97 percent compared to the excessive amount originally awarded by the jury. While the remaining sum is still disproportionately high, this significant reduction marks a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>The statement also applauded the narrowing of the injunction Meta requested to excluse NSO customers.</p>
<p>Pegasus is among the most advanced means of surveilling iPhones and Android devices. Pegasus often infects devices using &quot;zero-click&quot; exploits, meaning they require no interaction on the part of targeted users. Both Apple and Google expend significant resources to secure their operating systems; Pegasus defeats these defenses by spending large sums reverse-engineering the OSes.</p>
<p>NSO has said that it licenses Pegasus only to governments that a careful vetting shows don&#x27;t abuse their use of the spyware. As was demonstrated in the WhatsApp case, dissidents, journalists, and others have been targeted anyway.</p>
<p>The ruling is significant because, as Cathcart noted, it sets a precedent that other US parties who are in the same position as Meta can cite in any cases they bring against NSO.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Nation-state hackers deliver malware from “bulletproof” blockchains</h2>
<p><em>Ars Technology Lab - <a href='https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/hackers-bullet-proof-hosts-deliver-malware-from-blockchains/'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_5b8b69458df9.jpg'></p>
<p>Malicious payloads stored on Ethereum and BNB blockchains are immune to takedowns.</p>
<p>Hacking groups-at least one of which works on behalf of the North Korean government-have found a new and inexpensive way to distribute malware from &quot;bulletproof&quot; hosts: stashing them on public cryptocurrency blockchains.</p>
<p>In a Thursday post, members of the Google Threat Intelligence Group said the technique provides the hackers with their own &quot;bulletproof&quot; host, a term that describes cloud platforms that are largely immune from takedowns by law enforcement and pressure from security researchers. More traditionally, these hosts are located in countries without treaties agreeing to enforce criminal laws from the US and other nations. These services often charge hefty sums and cater to criminals spreading malware or peddling child sexual abuse material and wares sold in crime-based flea markets.</p>
<p>Since February, Google researchers have observed two groups turning to a newer technique to infect targets with credential stealers and other forms of malware. The method, known as EtherHiding, embeds the malware in smart contracts, which are essentially apps that reside on blockchains for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Two or more parties then enter into an agreement spelled out in the contract. When certain conditions are met, the apps enforce the contract terms in a way that, at least theoretically, is immutable and independent of any central authority.</p>
<p>&quot;In essence, EtherHiding represents a shift toward next-generation bulletproof hosting, where the inherent features of blockchain technology are repurposed for malicious ends,&quot; Google researchers Blas Kojusner, Robert Wallace, and Joseph Dobson wrote. &quot;This technique underscores the continuous evolution of cyber threats as attackers adapt and leverage new technologies to their advantage.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a wide array of advantages to EtherHiding over more traditional means of delivering malware, which besides bulletproof hosting include leveraging compromised servers.</p>
<p>Creating or modifying smart contracts typically cost less than $2 per transaction, a huge savings in terms of funds and labor over more traditional methods for delivering malware.</p>
<p>Layered on top of the EtherHiding Google observed was a social-engineering campaign that used recruiting for fake jobs to lure targets, many of whom were developers of cryptocurrency apps or other online services. During the screening process, candidates must perform a test demonstrating their coding or code-review skills. The files required to complete the tests are embedded with malicious code.</p>
<p>The infection process relies on a chain of malware that gets installed in stages. Later stages responsible for executing the final payloads are then installed through smart contracts that the hackers store on the Ethereum and the BNB Smart Chain blockchains, which accept uploads from anyone.</p>
<p>One of the groups Google observed, a North Korean-backed team tracked as UNC5342, uses earlier-stage malware tracked as JadeSnow to retrieve later-stage malware from both the BNB and Ethereum blockchains. The Google researchers observed:</p>
<p>It is unusual to see a threat actor make use of multiple blockchains for EtherHiding activity; this may indicate operational compartmentalization between teams of North Korean cyber operators. Lastly, campaigns frequently leverage EtherHiding&#x27;s flexible nature to update the infection chain and shift payload delivery locations. In one transaction, the JADESNOW downloader can switch from fetching a payload on Ethereum to fetching it on the BNB Smart Chain. This switch not only complicates analysis but also leverages lower transaction fees offered by alternate networks.</p>
<p>The researchers said they also observed another group, the financially motivated UNC5142, also employing EtherHiding.</p>
<p>North Korea&#x27;s hacking prowess was once considered low caliber. Over the past decade, the country has mounted a series of high-profile attack campaigns that demonstrate growing skill, focus, and resources. Two weeks ago, blockchain analysis firm Elliptic said the nation has stolen cryptocurrency valued at more than $2 billion so far in 2025.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>UK Athletics in profit for first time in eight years</h2>

<p>UK Athletics was awarded Â£150,000 by UK Sport to host the Diamond League meeting in 2024</p>
<p>UK Athletics has reported a surplus for the first time since 2017, two years after facing the threat of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>UK Athletics (UKA) introduced tighter cost controls and restructured internally - reducing staff numbers from 72 to 62 - and &quot;reducing support for some programmes&quot;.</p>
<p>UKA also struck a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; deal with the organisers of the London Marathon and Great North Run in 2024 to help it tackle financial crises.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very pleased that we are back in profit - it&#x27;s an important moment for UK Athletics and a real sign that the steps we have taken over the past two years are working,&quot; UKA chair Ian Beattie said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don&#x27;t underestimate how difficult it has been to get back to this position. It has taken hard decisions, careful management and the commitment of a great many people to turn things around.</p>
<p>&quot;The organisation has gone through a period of real change. We have had to make savings across every area, including redundancies and reduced support for some programmes outside the World Class Performance system.</p>
<p>&quot;Those decisions were extremely tough and never taken lightly, but they were necessary to secure the long-term stability of the sport. We are a leaner organisation now - more streamlined and more focused on the essentials and the right culture - but we are also a stronger one as a result.&quot;</p>

<p>Hodgkinson ran her personal best time of 1:54.61 in London last year</p>
<p>Keely Hodgkinson ended her 800m season with victory at the all-female Athlos meet in New York on Friday evening.</p>
<p>The Olympic champion, who won bronze at the World Championships last month, cruised to an impressive win in one minute 56.53 seconds in what was only her sixth race in a season blighted by a hamstring injury.</p>
<p>Fellow Briton and world silver medallist Georgia Hunter Bell was second again in 1:58.33, while St Vincent&#x27;s Shafiqua Maloney (1:58.57) was third.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve barely raced this season so it was probably less of a struggle for me to go out there and want to give it something,&quot; said Hodgkinson, 23.</p>
<p>&quot;The atmosphere out there is crazy so it was really, really fun.&quot;</p>
<p>The women-only meet packed Icahn Stadium in its second year, bringing a party atmosphere to traditional track, with live music and Tiffany &amp; Co. crowns replacing traditional winners&#x27; medals.</p>
<p>The 23-times tennis major winner Serena Williams, who is married to Athlos founder Alexis Ohanian, was on hand to present the winners with their crowns.</p>
<p>Last year&#x27;s winners took home $60,000 (Â£44,603) - one of the largest prize purses in athletics.</p>
<p>The event also attracted some of the sport&#x27;s biggest names, as Kenya&#x27;s three-time Olympic 1500m champion Faith Kipyegon won the mile, crossing the finish line in four minutes 17.78 seconds.</p>
<p>American Brittany Brown, the 200m bronze medallist from last year&#x27;s Paris Olympics, won the 100m and 200m double.</p>

<p><em>BBC Business - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgv102n4gwo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_766e11b6af3e.jpg'></p>
<p>The collapse of two US companies could be a sign of wider problems in the financial system and &quot;alarm bells&quot; were ringing, the governor of the Bank of England has said.</p>
<p>Andrew Bailey told a House of Lords committee that it was important to take the failure of car parts supplier First Brands and subprime car lender Tricolor &quot;very seriously&quot; - and drew parallels with the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>He said it was unclear whether these were one-off issues, or a case of &quot;the canary in the coal mine&quot;.</p>
<p>Mr Bailey also said the Bank of England was planning to run a &quot;stress test&quot; of private equity and credit firms.</p>
<p>The bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor have raised questions about the quality of deals in what is known as the private credit market - where companies arrange loans from non-bank lenders.</p>
<p>Mr Bailey said he did not want &quot;to sound too foreboding at this point&quot;, but that &quot;there is a lot we don&#x27;t know about First Brands and Tricolour&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the big question... is: are these cases idiosyncratic, or are they what I call the canary in the coalmine?</p>
<p>&quot;Are they telling us something more fundamental about the private finance and private assets sector?</p>
<p>&quot;I think that&#x27;s still a very open question in the US. I think it&#x27;s a question we have to take very seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>On the way loans were being made by private credit, Mr Bailey said there was starting to be &quot;what used to be called sort of slicing and dicing and tranching of loan structures&quot;.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the tone of the conversation prior to the 2008 financial crisis, he said that back then there had been a belief that sub-prime mortgages were &quot;too small to be systematic&quot; but that this had been &quot;the wrong call&quot;.</p>
<p>Last week, Jamie Dimon, the boss of US banking giant JPMorgan Chase, warned the failure of the two US firms could be a sign of more to come.</p>
<p>&quot;My antenna goes up when things like that happen,&quot; he told analysts. &quot;I probably shouldn&#x27;t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.&quot;</p>
<p>Also appearing before the House of Lords&#x27; financial services regulation committee, Sarah Breeden, the Bank&#x27;s deputy governor for financial stability, said the Bank would be examining the private finance sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We can see the vulnerabilities here,&quot; she said. &quot;We can see parallels with the global financial crisis.&quot;</p>

<p><em>BBC Business - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxknd9l474o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_9df190e7199d.webp'></p>
<p>The company behind weight-loss jab Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic will have a boardroom clear-out, with seven board members including the chairman set to depart.</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk on Tuesday said chairman Helge Lund, vice chair Henrik Poulsen and five directors will not stand for re-election at an extraordinary investor meeting in November.</p>
<p>The departures came about after a disagreement between the board and its majority shareholder over its future governance.</p>
<p>Last month the firm issued a warning on profits due to increased competition from US rivals, and announced a cost-savings programme as it cut its profit growth forecast for the third time this year.</p>
<p>Widespread adoption of Novo Nordisk&#x27;s Ozempic diabetes treatment, which is often used off-label as a weight loss drug, and Wegovy had boosted its share price to the point where in summer 2024 it was Europe&#x27;s most-valuable company.</p>
<p>The departures come after a disagreement between board members from the pharmaceutical company and its majority shareholder, the non-profit Novo Nordisk Foundation, on the extent of changes needed.</p>
<p>Outgoing chair Mr Lund said that the Novo Nordisk board had proposed bringing in several new board members to add new skills, but the Novo Nordisk Foundation &quot;wanted a more extensive reconfiguration&quot;.</p>
<p>The Foundation successfully pushed for the removal of former chief executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen in May.</p>
<p>The current chairman of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, Lars Rebien Sorensen, who served as the pharma&#x27;s chief executive from 2000 to 2016, is being put forward to replace current chairman Mr Lund, the foundation said.</p>
<p>Mr Sorensen said the pharmaceutical company had been &quot;too slow in recognising fundamental market changes&quot; as the use of its drugs became mainstream and competitors launched rival treatments.</p>
<p>The claim involves 3,000 people and focuses on internal memos and scientific reports, seen by the BBC.</p>
<p>Dad-of-two Martin Fletcher said he managed to lose 10 stone in 13 months through daily exercise.</p>
<p>The council has approved the work after production at the Ulverston site ended earlier this year.</p>

<p>British designer Grace Wales Bonner has been named as the new creative director of menswear for French fashion house Hermès.</p>
<p>The appointment means Wales Bonner, a 35-year-old Londoner, is now the first black woman to lead design at a major fashion house, according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>In a statement, Wales Bonner said she was &quot;deeply honoured to be entrusted with the role&quot;.</p>
<p>She replaces Véronique Nichanian, who has been the company&#x27;s artistic director of menswear division for 37 years.</p>
<p>Her final collection for the brand will be shown in Paris in January, while Wales Bonner&#x27;s first collection will launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In her statement, Wales Bonner said: &quot;It is a dream realised to embark on this new chapter, following in a lineage of inspired craftspeople and designers.&quot;</p>
<p>She also thanked the company&#x27;s bosses &quot;for the opportunity to bring my vision to this magical house&quot;.</p>
<p>Reporting the news on Tuesday, Vogue said: &quot;While industry insiders were betting on a promotion from within, Hermès went for a renowned talent.&quot;</p>
<p>Wales Bonner, who was born in London to an English mother and Jamaican father, founded her own label in 2014, not long after graduating from London&#x27;s Central Saint Martins College of Art.</p>
<p>According to Vogue, Wales Bonner will continue her namesake brand alongside her new Hermès role.</p>
<p>She dressed F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, musician FKA Twigs, and actor Jeff Goldblum for this year&#x27;s Met Gala and has made T-shirts with musician Solange Knowles, younger sister of Beyoncé.</p>
<p>Wales Bonner has also curated an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and hosted musical performances at London&#x27;s Serpentine Galleries.</p>
<p>She has had a long-standing collaboration with Adidas and was made a MBE in 2022 for services to fashion.</p>
<p>Pierre-Alexis Dumas, general artistic director of Hermès, said: &quot;I am really pleased to welcome Grace to the Hermès artistic director family.</p>
<p>&quot;Her take on contemporary fashion, craft and culture will contribute to shaping Hermès men&#x27;s style, melding the house&#x27;s heritage with a confident look on the now.</p>

<p>Bad Boy Chiller Crew forgive anyone who forgot about them.</p>
<p>The trio&#x27;s brand of Bradford bassline earned them a UK top 10 single with BMW in 2022.</p>
<p>And their first album, Disrespectful, would have made number one if Ed Sheeran&#x27;s = (Equals) hadn&#x27;t got in its way.</p>
<p>By 2023 Gareth &quot;GK&quot; Kelly, Kane Welsh and Sam &quot;Clive&quot; Robinson were riding high, nominated for group of the year at the Brits alongside The 1975 and Arctic Monkeys.</p>
<p>Just as they were building momentum, they tell BBC Newsbeat, they were forced to hit pause when a legal dispute erupted with record label House Anxiety.</p>
<p>Unable to release new tracks, they swapped making music for combing through contracts. Kane says it was like &quot;jogging on the spot&quot;.</p>
<p>In July, a judge confirmed that a deal between the band and the record label had expired.</p>
<p>The group admit they&#x27;d considered going their separate ways during their hiatus.</p>
<p>&quot;I was ready to give it up,&quot; GK tells Newsbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn&#x27;t earn a living. What we had left got thrown into solicitor and court fees.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the worst time of our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Kane says it&#x27;s a relief to share music they&#x27;ve had ready and waiting on hard drives for months.</p>
<p>&quot;We were putting all this work and effort in, eight hours a day, making music that we couldn&#x27;t even release,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>GK adds: &quot;But what we&#x27;re trying to do is bring the old sound back.&quot;</p>
<p>The band are drip-feeding fans remixes of songs from their breakthrough mixtape, Full Wack No Breaks.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Trump says he did not want &#x27;wasted meeting&#x27; after plan for Putin talks shelved</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjp73gp41o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_3ae024ab493c.webp'></p>
<p>Donald Trump has said he did not want a &quot;wasted meeting&quot; after a plan to have face-to-face talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about the war in Ukraine were put on hold.</p>
<p>The US president indicated that a key sticking point remained Moscow&#x27;s refusal to cease fighting along the current front line, in remarks at the White House on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Key differences between US and Russian proposals for peace became increasingly clear this week, appearing to have dashed chances of a summit.</p>
<p>Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August, during a hastily organised summit which yielded no concrete results.</p>
<p>The White House decision to shelve plans for a second Trump-Putin meeting may be seen as an attempt to avoid another similar scenario.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess the Russians wanted too much and it became evident for the Americans that there will be no deal for Trump in Budapest,&quot; a senior European diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was due to be held this week - but the White House said the two had had a &quot;productive&quot; call and that a meeting was no longer &quot;necessary&quot;.</p>
<p>On Monday, Trump embraced a ceasefire proposal backed by Kyiv and European leaders to freeze the conflict on the current front line.</p>
<p>&quot;Let it be cut the way it is,&quot; he said. &quot;I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia has repeatedly pushed back against freezing the current line of contact.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that &quot;the consistency of Russia&#x27;s position doesn&#x27;t change&quot; - referring to Moscow&#x27;s insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.</p>
<p>Moscow was only interested in &quot;long-term, sustainable peace&quot;, Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.</p>
<p>The &quot;root causes of the conflict&quot; needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine - a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.</p>
<p>European leaders released a statement with Zelensky earlier on Tuesday saying that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line and accused Russia of not being &quot;serious&quot; about peace.</p>
<p>Zelensky said discussions about the front line were the &quot;beginning of diplomacy&quot;, which Russia was doing everything to avoid.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Third survivor quits grooming gang inquiry panel</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykd173l3vo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_df71c3dce7a7.webp'></p>
<p>A third abuse survivor has resigned from their role in the government&#x27;s inquiry into grooming gangs.</p>
<p>&quot;Elizabeth&quot; - not her real name - joined Fiona Goddard and Ellie Reynolds, who quit the inquiry&#x27;s victims and survivors liaison panel on Monday in protest.</p>
<p>In her resignation letter, Elizabeth said the process felt like &quot;a cover-up&quot; and had &quot;created a toxic environment for survivors&quot;.</p>
<p>Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has denied claims of a cover-up and insisted her government was &quot;committed to exposing the failures&quot; to tackle &quot;these appalling crimes&quot;.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who is from Rotherham, said she felt the process had been &quot;scripted and predetermined&quot;, &quot;rather than emerging from honest, open dialogue with survivors&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This sense of control and stage-management has left many of us questioning whether our voices truly matter, or whether we are being used to legitimise decisions that have already been made,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Survivors have been concerned that if people are already giving up on the inquiry it will not be able to gain the trust and confidence of others affected.</p>
<p>There is also frustration around the length of time it has taking to appoint a chairperson, with some seeing this as a delay tactic because of fears of what might be exposed.</p>
<p>The government is under pressure to come up with a plan that satisfies the survivors at the heart of this scandal.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced in June there would be a national inquiry into grooming gangs covering England and Wales, with a panel of survivors set up to oversee the process.</p>
<p>However, a chairperson has yet to be appointed.</p>
<p>The BBC has been told former senior social worker Annie Hudson, who had been named as a potential chairperson, has withdrawn following recent media coverage over her candidacy.</p>
<p>One of the other names being considered is former deputy chief constable Jim Gamble.</p>
<p>A meeting between Mr Gamble and survivors took place earlier, with both sides said to have listened to each other&#x27;s perspectives.</p>
<p>Ms Goddard and Ms Reynolds had raised concerns about the suitability of the candidates shortlisted to chair the inquiry, arguing they should not have a background in policing or social work.</p>

<p><em>BBC Science - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mxzdg203jo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_dd45186bedb5.webp'></p>
<p>She&#x27;s the astronaut who smashed through the glass ceiling. And kept on going.</p>
<p>Eileen Collins made history as the first woman to pilot and command a Nasa spacecraft - but despite her remarkable achievements, not everyone will know her name.</p>
<p>Now a feature-length documentary called Spacewoman, which chronicles her trailblazing career, looks set to change that.</p>
<p>We meet Collins at London&#x27;s Science Museum. She&#x27;s softly spoken, warm and very down to earth - but you quickly get a sense of her focus and determination. She clearly has inner steel.</p>
<p>&quot;I was reading a magazine article on the Gemini astronauts. I was probably nine years old, and I thought that&#x27;s the coolest thing. That&#x27;s what I want to do,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, there were no women astronauts back then. But I just thought, I&#x27;ll be a lady astronaut.&quot;</p>
<p>But that little girl set her sights even higher - she wanted to be at the controls of a spacecraft.</p>
<p>And the only way to achieve this was to join the military and become a test pilot.</p>
<p>In the Air Force, she stood out from the crowd and was selected to join the astronaut programme. She was to fly Space Shuttles - Nasa&#x27;s reusable &quot;space planes&quot;.</p>
<p>She knew the eyes of the world were on her when her first mission launched in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;As the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle, I worked very hard at that because I didn&#x27;t want people to say, &#x27;Oh look, the woman has made a mistake&#x27;. Because it wasn&#x27;t just about me, it was about the women to follow me,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;And I wanted there to be a reputation for women pilots that was: &#x27;Hey, they&#x27;re really good&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>She was so good in fact that she was soon promoted to commander, in another first.</p>
<p>Collins was also a parent to two young children. The fact that she was a working wife and mother was frequently brought up in press conferences at the time, with some journalists seemingly astonished that she could be both.</p>
<p>But Collins says being a mum and a commander were &quot;the two best jobs in the world&quot;.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>From Hollywood to horticulture: Cate Blanchett on a mission to save seeds</h2>
<p><em>BBC Science - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7ekl4yl8o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_fb0d9be7c195.webp'></p>
<p>She&#x27;s a Hollywood A-lister, with a mantelpiece groaning under the weight of awards. But Cate Blanchett has taken an unexpected diversion from her day job - to immerse herself in the world of the humble seed.</p>
<p>Her eyes light up as she enthuses about the banksia species from her native Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s quite a brutal looking seed pod that only releases its seed in extremely high temperatures,&quot; she tells us.</p>
<p>&quot;It does look like a cross between a mallet and a toilet brush. So they&#x27;re not always pretty, but yet what comes out of them is so spectacular.&quot;</p>
<p>We meet her at Kew&#x27;s Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) at Wakehurst botanic garden in Sussex. She lives locally and teamed up with the project as it celebrates its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>&quot;Really, I stumbled upon Wakehurst. I was just in awe of the landscape and I always feel regenerated by being in the natural world,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;And then I discovered the seed bank, and I literally had my mind blown by the work that goes on here... and I thought, anything I can do to be connected to it - I found it so inspiring.&quot;</p>
<p>The MSB is home to more than 2.5 billion seeds collected from 40,000 wild plant species around the world.</p>
<p>The seeds, which come in every shape, size and colour, are carefully processed, dried and then stored in freezers at a chilly -20C.</p>
<p>The conservation project was opened by The King - then the Prince of Wales - in 2000. He&#x27;s taken part in a special episode of a Kew podcast about the project called Unearthed: The Need For Seeds with Cate Blanchett.</p>
<p>In the recording he talks about his concerns that many plant species are being lost.</p>
<p>&quot;I know how absolutely critical it all is, and the destruction of rainforests, the extinction of endless species, which have very likely remarkable properties,&quot; he tells the podcast.</p>
<p>When the seed bank first opened, it was seen as a doomsday vault - a back-up store of seeds to safeguard wild plants from extinction.</p>
<p>But 25 years on, the collection is being used for a different purpose: to restore environments that are under threat.</p>
<p>&quot;We want those seeds to be back out in the landscape,&quot; explained Dr Elinor Breman from the MSB, who&#x27;s been showing Cate Blanchett the team&#x27;s work.</p>

<p>Jannik Sinner was world number one until losing the US Open final to Carlos Alcaraz in September</p>
<p>Four-time Grand Slam champion Jannik Sinner will not be part of the Italy team aiming to clinch a third consecutive Davis Cup title next month.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old reached all four Grand Slam singles finals in 2025, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and won the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Saudi Arabia on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sinner is scheduled to take part in the ATP Tour Finals in Turin from 9-16 November, but Italy captain Filippo Volandri said the world number two had &quot;not given his availability&quot; to play at the Davis Cup in Bologna from 18-23 November.</p>
<p>World number one Carlos Alcaraz has been named in Spain&#x27;s team.</p>
<p>Sinner dominates Alcaraz at lucrative Six Kings Slam</p>
<p>&#x27;Sport must adapt&#x27;, says Draper after Rune injury</p>
<p>Sinner says he has taken the decision to miss the Davis Cup so he can have extra preparation time for the start of next season, with the Australian Open being the first Grand Slam of the year in January.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t an easy decision, but after Turin, the goal is to get off on the right foot in Australia,&quot; Sinner told Sky Sport Italy. &quot;It may not seem like it, but a week of preparation during that period can make all the difference.</p>
<p>&quot;We won the Davis Cup in 2023 and 2024, and this time we decided this with my team.&quot;</p>
<p>Lorenzo Musetti and Flavio Cobolli, eighth and 22nd in the world respectively, will be the highest-ranked singles players on show for Italy, who face Austria in their quarter-final.</p>
<p>Volandri said: &quot;The Davis Cup is, and will remain, always his home and I am sure that Jannik will soon be part of the team again.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime, I can count on a group ready to fight and give everything for the blue jersey.&quot;</p>
<p>Sinner&#x27;s absence comes after several players voiced concerns about a demanding tennis calendar in recent weeks.</p>
<p>After Holger Rune sustained a season-ending injury at the Nordic Open on Saturday, British number one Jack Draper posted on social media that &quot;the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity&quot;.</p>

<p>Venue: Wrexham Tennis and Padel Centre Date: 21-26 October</p>
<p>Coverage: Watch live on BBC Sport online and BBC iPlayer</p>
<p>Italy&#x27;s second seed Camilla Rosatello was knocked out in the opening match of the Wrexham Open by Slovakia&#x27;s Katarina Kuzmova.</p>
<p>Rosatello dropped the first set but bounced back to win the second on a tie-break to force a deciding set.</p>
<p>However, the 30-year-old was broken early in that final set by Kuzmova, and went on to lose 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (4-7) 6-4.</p>
<p>There was to be no such problem for fourth seed Kathinka von Deichmann of Liechtenstein or fifth seed Raluca Georgiana Serban of Cyprus.</p>
<p>Serban was forced to do things the hard way, however, after dropping the first set against Great Britain&#x27;s Ranah Akua Stoiber.</p>
<p>Serban responded by racing through the second set, and while Stoiber forced a tie-break in the decider, the 28-year-old Cypriot would go on to win 1-6 6-0 7-6 (7-5).</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the first round of the women&#x27;s singles there were straight-set wins for Jana Otzipka, Elena Malygina, and Lucie Havlickova, plus Britain&#x27;s Amarni Banks, who is ranked 295th in the world and beat Finland&#x27;s Laura Hietaranta 6-4 6-0.</p>
<p>Mimi Xu was beaten by Emma Raducanu in the first round of the women&#x27;s singles at Wimbledon this year</p>
<p>The home crowd in attendance in Wrexham on the opening day were firmly behind Welsh 18-year-old Mimi Xu in the first round of the women&#x27;s doubles.</p>
<p>Xu and McDonald continued their dominance into the second set, and dropped just two further games on the way to completing a 6-3 6-2 win in north Wales.</p>
<p>They will face third seeds Naima Karamoko of Switzerland and Jessika Ponchet of France in the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Ponchet and Karamoko cruised through 6-0 6-1 against Britain&#x27;s Georgiana Mititelu and Elizabeth Evans.</p>

<p>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Democrats rallied Tuesday against a new U.S. House map proposed by North Carolina Republicans that would likely reap another GOP seat at President Donald Trump&#x27;s behest, but the critics acknowledged they&#x27;ll likely be unable to halt the redraw for now. But they vowed to defeat it in the long run.</p>
<p>The new map offered by Republican legislative leaders seeks to stop the reelection of Democratic Rep. Don Davis, one of North Carolina&#x27;s three Black representatives, by redrawing two of the state&#x27;s 14 congressional districts. Statewide election data suggests the proposal - which received final Senate approval and cleared a House redistricting committee on Tuesday along party lines - would favor Republicans winning 11 of those seats, up from the current 10 they hold.</p>
<p>With Republicans in the majority in both General Assembly chambers and state law preventing Democratic Gov. Josh Stein from using his veto stamp against a redistricting plan, the GOP-drawn map appeared headed to enactment after final House votes as soon as Wednesday.</p>
<p>The boundary changes attempt to satisfy Trump&#x27;s call for states led by Republicans to conduct mid-decade redistricting to gain more seats and retain his party&#x27;s grip on Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats need to gain just three more seats to seize control of the House, and the president&#x27;s party historically has lost seats in midterm elections.</p>
<p>Still, about 300 protesters, Democratic Party officials and lawmakers gathering outside the old state Capitol pledged repeatedly Tuesday that redrawing the congressional map would have negative consequences for the GOP at the ballot box in 2026 and beyond. Litigation to challenge the enactment on the map also is likely on allegations of unlawful racial gerrymandering.</p>
<p>&quot;We know we may not have the ability to stop the Republicans in Raleigh right now ... but we are here to show that people across this state and across this nation are watching them,&quot; North Carolina Democratic Party chair Anderson Clayton said to cheers.</p>
<p>The gathering served Democrats to censure state Republicans they accuse of agreeing to kneel to Trump through a corrupt redrawing of district lines to target Davis.</p>
<p>State GOP leaders defended their action, saying Trump has won the state&#x27;s electoral votes all three times that he&#x27;s run for president - albeit narrowly - and thus merits more potential support in Congress.</p>
<p>The national redistricting battle began over the summer when Trump urged Republican-led Texas to reshape its U.S. House districts. After Texas lawmakers acted, California Democrats reciprocated by passing their own plan, which still needs voter approval in November.</p>
<p>Republicans argue that other Democratic-leaning states had already given themselves a disproportionate number of seats well before this national redistricting fight started.</p>
<p>&quot;It is incumbent upon us to react to this environment, to respond to this environment, and not let these tactics that have happened in blue states dominate the control of Congress,&quot; state Sen. Ralph Hise, the map&#x27;s chief author, said during Tuesday&#x27;s Senate debate.</p>
<p>Several speakers at the Democrats&#x27; rally roused the crowd&#x27;s outrage at what they criticized as a speedy and unfair redistricting process deliberately designed to grab the seat that Davis won by less than 2 percentage points in 2024.</p>
<p>Texas state Rep. Nicole Collier, who took part in a two-week legislative walkout in her state opposition to the pro-Trump redistricting, encouraged those present to vote in upcoming elections and ensure others they know to do likewise.</p>

<p><em>PBS NewsHour - <a href='https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/warner-bros-discovery-confirms-it-has-received-buyout-interest-and-is-considering-its-options'>Original</a></em></p>

<p>Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Associated Press Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Associated Press</p>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) - Warner Bros. Discovery - the home of HBO, CNN and DC Studios - has signaled that it may be open to selling all or parts of its business, just months after announcing plans to split into two companies.</p>
<p>In an announcement Tuesday, the entertainment and media giant said it had initiated a review of &quot;strategic alternatives&quot; in light of &quot;unsolicited interest&quot; it had received from multiple parties, for both the entire company and Warner Bros. specifically.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery did not specify where that interest was coming from, and a spokesperson said the company couldn&#x27;t share additional information when reached by The Associated Press. But its review arrives after growing reports of a potential bidding war - including from Skydance-owned Paramount, which closed its own $8 billion merger in early August.</p>
<p>Citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Paramount approached Warner Bros. Discovery about a majority-cash offer in late September - but that Warner Chief Executive David Zaslav had rebuffed those first overtures. According to the outlet, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison later considered taking a more aggressive approach, such as going directly to shareholders.</p>
<p>CNBC has also reported that Netflix and Comcast are among other interested parties, citing unnamed sources. Comcast declined to comment Tuesday. Paramount and Netflix did not immediately respond to the AP&#x27;s requests for statements.</p>
<p>If a sale of all or part of Warner Bros. Discovery arrives, it would mark a considerable shift in the U.S. media landscape that is &quot;already trending towards a concerning level of consolidation,&quot; said Mike Proulx, VP research director at Forrester.</p>
<p>He pointed to the streaming space in particular - noting that, on one hand, a potential transaction could help scale the company&#x27;s streamers to better compete with other platforms. But on the other hand, consumers could see fewer choices controlled by just a handful of corporate giants.</p>
<p>&quot;When just a few conglomerates, like Skydance, increasingly control the lion&#x27;s share of some of the most popular platforms, it raises all sorts of questions around the future of content diversity and expression,&quot; Proulx said over email Tuesday. &quot;Bigger is better might be good for shareholders but will consumers ultimately benefit with better quality content, lower prices, and accessibility?&quot;</p>
<p>Still, he added, much of that will depend on if a sale happens and who ends up buying Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>
<p>Back in June, Warner Bros. Discovery outlined plans to split its cable and streaming offerings - with HBO, HBO Max, as well as Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, to become part of a new streaming and studios company; while networks like CNN, Discovery and TNT Sports and digital products such as the Discovery+ streaming service and Bleacher Report would make up a separate cable counterpart.</p>
<p>Warner expected the split to be complete by mid-2026 - and said Tuesday that continuing to advance this separation was still among the options it&#x27;s considering.</p>
<p>&quot;We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward,&quot; Zaslav said in a statement. Still, he added, &quot;it&#x27;s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said that there&#x27;s no definite timeline for its review process - and noted that, beyond the separation that is already underway, &quot;there can be no assurance&quot; that a transaction will emerge.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery was created just three years ago when AT&amp;T spun off WarnerMedia, which was merged with Discovery Communications in a $43 billion deal. An even bigger transaction could attract antitrust scrutiny - but like other recent mega-mergers and proposed transactions, could find success under the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Protecting your brain&#x27;s energy and keeping your mind sharp might start with what&#x27;s on your plate. Foods such as fish and seafood, meat, non-starchy vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, eggs, and even full-fat dairy may play a key role in maintaining cognitive health.</p>
<p>Exploring the Power of the Ketogenic Diet</p>
<p>At the University of Missouri, researchers are exploring how these foods influence brain function. Their work focuses on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan known as the ketogenic diet. Early results suggest that this approach could not only support long-term brain health but also slow or even prevent cognitive decline, especially among individuals who face a higher genetic risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</p>
<p>Inside the Roy Blunt NextGen Precision Health building, Ai-Ling Lin, a professor in the School of Medicine, and doctoral student Kira Ivanich are examining how the ketogenic diet may benefit people with the APOE4 gene, which is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</p>
<p>In their recent study using mice, Lin and Ivanich found that females with the APOE4 gene developed healthier gut bacteria and showed higher brain energy levels when following a ketogenic diet compared to those on a high-carbohydrate diet. Males did not show the same improvement, suggesting that gender may influence who benefits most from this dietary approach.</p>
<p>The key lies in how the brain produces its energy.</p>
<p>&quot;When we eat carbs, our brains convert the glucose into fuel for our brains, but those with the APOE4 gene -- particularly females -- struggle to convert the glucose into brain energy, and this can lead to cognitive decline down the road,&quot; Ivanich said. &quot;By switching to a keto diet, ketones are produced and used as an alternative fuel source. This may decrease the chance of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s by preserving the health of brain cells.&quot;</p>
<p>These findings highlight the potential of &quot;precision nutrition,&quot; an approach that adapts diets and interventions to fit a person&#x27;s unique biology.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of expecting one solution to work for everyone, it might be better to consider a variety of factors, including someone&#x27;s genotype, gut microbiome, gender and age,&quot; Lin said. &quot;Since the symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s -- which tend to be irreversible once they start -- usually appear after age 65, the time to be thinking about preserving brain health is well before then, so hopefully our research can offer hope to many people through early interventions.&quot;</p>
<p>Advancing Research Through Collaboration</p>
<p>Lin joined Mizzou in part for its collaborative environment and advanced imaging facilities located in the NextGen Precision Health building and at the University of Missouri Research Reactor.</p>
<p>&quot;We can do a lot of things in-house here that at other places we would have to outsource,&quot; Lin said. &quot;This is team science. The impact we make will be much better when we work together than by ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>With cutting-edge imaging equipment and both research and clinical spaces under the same roof, the NextGen Precision Health building allows Mizzou to move quickly from preclinical models to human trials.</p>
<p>For Ivanich, that real-world impact is personal.</p>
<p>&quot;When my grandmother got Alzheimer&#x27;s, that sparked my interest in this topic, so being able to make an impact to help people preserve their brain health is very rewarding,&quot; she said. &quot;With Mizzou being a leading research university and having a tight-knit community feel, I know I&#x27;m at the right place.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>This simple innovation could change blood pressure testing forever</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083644.htm'>Original</a></em></p>

<p>A newly developed method that improves the accuracy of ankle blood pressure measurements could transform care for people who are unable to have their blood pressure taken from the arm.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Exeter Medical School, in a study published in BMJ Open and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), analyzed data from more than 33,000 individuals to create a personalized predictive model. This model enables healthcare professionals to estimate arm blood pressure more precisely using ankle readings (when compared with earlier approaches). To make the process easier to use, the team has also launched an online calculator that helps both clinicians and patients interpret ankle-based results.</p>
<p>Why Accuracy in Blood Pressure Measurement Matters</p>
<p>More than one billion people worldwide live with high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. Reliable measurements are crucial for diagnosing and managing the condition effectively.</p>
<p>Although blood pressure is typically measured on the upper arm, some people cannot have it taken there due to disability, limb loss, or conditions such as stroke. In such cases, readings are taken from the ankle. However, ankle measurements are usually higher than arm readings, and because treatment guidelines are based on arm data, this difference can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate treatment decisions.</p>
<p>Improving Accuracy and Reducing Misdiagnoses</p>
<p>Professor Chris Clark, who led the research, explained: &quot;Our new method will give a more accurate blood pressure reading for around two percent more people. This doesn&#x27;t sound a big number but remember, around a third of adults have high blood pressure and once you get into your 60s it&#x27;s more than half of the adults. The NHS Health Check Programme diagnoses 38,000 new cases annually in England alone, so two percent equates to 750 fewer potential misdiagnoses per year in England, and tens of thousands globally.&quot;</p>
<p>To achieve this, the researchers used statistical modeling on data from 33,710 people (mean age 58 years, 45 per cent female) across multiple countries. The analysis explored the relationship between arm and ankle blood pressures, developed a predictive equation for estimating arm values from ankle readings, and examined how ankle readings relate to important health outcomes (such as heart attack risk).</p>
<p>This advancement could help close a significant health gap by providing accurate and personalized blood pressure results for people who have been excluded from standard monitoring. It is estimated that up to 10,000 adults in the UK live with upper limb loss, while 75 per cent of the country&#x27;s 1.3 million stroke survivors experience upper limb difficulties that can make arm-based measurements challenging or impossible.</p>
<p>The project received support from the Stroke Association and the Thalidomide Trust, two organizations advocating for people affected by these conditions.</p>
<p>Expert Reactions and Public Health Impact</p>
<p>Juliet Bouverie OBE, CEO of the Stroke Association, said: &quot;Someone in the UK has a stroke every five minutes, with high blood pressure accounting for around half of those. Around two-thirds of stroke survivors will leave hospital with some form of disability, including paralysis in an arm, which can prevent getting accurate blood pressure readings from the affected limb. Many stroke survivors feel anxious about having another stroke, so receiving an accurate blood pressure reading in the ankle will not only provide benefits in the primary prevention of stroke, but importantly in easing the minds of stroke survivors who are already dealing with the devastating impact of stroke.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Kevin Munro, Director of NIHR&#x27;s Research for Patient Benefit Programme, said: &quot;This research has identified an ingenious solution to an important problem -- finding a way to measure blood pressure for people who cannot have it monitored via the upper arm. Keeping track of blood pressure is a vital tool to help keep people healthy and this NIHR-funded research will help to spot high blood pressure and treat it even more widely.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Scientists stumble on a hidden quantum trick in 2D materials</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - Technology - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083640.htm'>Original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_4dec8bd33015.webp'></p>
<p>When arranged in just the right ways, two-dimensional materials can display unusual and valuable quantum effects such as superconductivity and exotic types of magnetism. Understanding why these effects arise, and how to control them, remains one of the biggest challenges for physicists and engineers. A new study published in Nature Physics has uncovered a previously unseen property that may explain how these mysterious quantum phases form and evolve.</p>
<p>Using a novel terahertz (THz) spectroscopy method, researchers found that thin stacks of 2D materials -- commonly used in laboratories worldwide -- can naturally create what are called cavities. These tiny spaces confine both light and electrons into even smaller regions, significantly altering their interactions and behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve uncovered a hidden layer of control in quantum materials and opened a path to shaping light-matter interactions in ways that could help us both understand exotic phases of matter and ultimately harness them for future quantum technologies,&quot; said James McIver, assistant professor of physics at Columbia and lead author of the paper.</p>
<p>The work traces its origins to Hamburg, where McIver led a research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD). The institute is part of the Max Planck-New York Center on Nonequilibrium Quantum Phenomena, a collaboration among MPSD, Columbia, the Flatiron Institute, and Cornell University. Researchers at the Center study how stable physical systems respond when pushed away from equilibrium.</p>
<p>McIver&#x27;s team explores these questions through light. &quot;2D materials, with their fascinating macroscopic properties, often behave like black boxes. By shining light on them, we can literally shed light on the hidden behavior of their electrons, revealing details that would otherwise remain unseen,&quot; said Gunda Kipp, a PhD student at MPSD and first author of the paper. One obstacle, however, is that the wavelengths of light needed to probe 2D materials are far larger than the materials themselves, which are thinner than a human hair.</p>
<p>To overcome this scale mismatch, the researchers developed a chip-sized spectroscope that compresses THz light -- the range where many quantum effects occur -- from about 1 millimeter down to just 3 micrometers. This compact design made it possible to directly observe how electrons move within 2D materials. They first tested their approach using graphene, a well-known form of carbon, to measure its optical conductivity.</p>
<p>What they found was unexpected: distinct standing waves.</p>
<p>&quot;Light can couple to electrons to form hybrid light-matter quasiparticles. These quasiparticles move as waves and, under certain conditions, they can become confined, much like the standing wave on a guitar string that produces a distinct note,&quot; explained MPSD postdoctoral fellow and co-first-author Hope Bretscher.</p>
<p>In a guitar, the string&#x27;s fixed ends define where the wave can form. Pressing a finger on the string shortens the wave, changing the pitch of the note. In optics, a similar process occurs when two mirrors trap light between them, creating a standing wave inside what scientists call a cavity. When a material is placed inside that cavity, the trapped light can repeatedly interact with it, altering its electronic properties.</p>
<p>However, the researchers discovered that mirrors might not even be necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;We found that the material&#x27;s own edges already act as mirrors,&quot; said Kipp. With their THz spectroscope, they observed that excited streams of electrons reflect off the edges to form a type of hybrid light-matter quasiparticle called a plasmon polariton.</p>
<p>The McIver lab studied a device made up of multiple layers, each of which can act as a cavity separated by a few tens of nanometers. The plasmons that form in each layer can, in turn, interact -- often strongly. &quot;It&#x27;s like connecting two guitar strings; once linked, the note changes,&quot; said Bretscher. &quot;In our case, it changes drastically.&quot;</p>
<p>The next step was to understand what determines the frequencies of these quasiparticles and how tightly light and matter couple together. &quot;With co-author and MPSD postdoctoral fellow Marios Michael, we developed an analytical theory that only needed a handful of geometric sample parameters to match the observations of our experiments,&quot; said Kipp. &quot;With just a click of a button, our theory can extract the properties of a material and will help us design and tailor future samples to obtain specific properties. For example, by tracking resonances as functions of carrier density, temperature, or magnetic field, we may uncover the mechanisms driving different quantum phases.&quot;</p>
<p>While this study focused on plasmons, the new chip-scale THz spectroscope could detect other types of quasiparticles oscillating in many different 2D materials. The team is already testing new samples in both Hamburg and New York.</p>
<p>&quot;This whole project was a bit of a serendipitous discovery. We didn&#x27;t expect to see</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Physicists discover strange spinning crystals that behave like living matter</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - Technology - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083635.htm'>Original</a></em></p>

<p>It may sound unbelievable, but crystals made of rotating particles are real. A group of physicists from Aachen, Düsseldorf, Mainz, and Wayne State University (Detroit, USA) has explored these unusual materials and their remarkable behavior. These crystals can easily split into separate fragments, form unusual grain boundaries, and display controllable structural defects. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the researchers present a broad theoretical framework that can predict several new properties of these so-called &quot;transverse interaction&quot; systems.</p>
<p>Rotating Systems in Nature and Technology</p>
<p>&quot;Transverse forces&quot; can appear not only in engineered materials, such as certain magnetic solids, but also in biological systems. In an experiment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), researchers observed that groups of starfish embryos, through their swimming motions, influenced each other&#x27;s movement in a way that caused them to rotate around one another. The biological function of this coordinated motion remains unclear, but it shares the same fundamental feature found in these synthetic systems: interacting, rotating objects.</p>
<p>Professor Dr. Hartmut Löwen from the Institute of Theoretical Physics II at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (HHU) explains: &quot;A system of many rotating constituent elements exhibits a qualitatively new behavior that is non-intuitive: At high concentrations, these objects form a solid body of rotors, which possess &#x27;odd&#x27; material properties.&quot;</p>
<p>One such property is known as &quot;odd elasticity.&quot; Normally, when a material is pulled, it stretches along the direction of the force. In contrast, an odd elastic material does not stretch -- it twists instead.</p>
<p>Twisting, Breaking, and Reforming</p>
<p>This kind of &quot;odd&quot; solid can even disintegrate on its own. When the rotating building blocks rub together strongly enough, the solid can fragment into many smaller spinning crystallites. Even more surprisingly, these fragments can later reassemble themselves into a coherent structure once again.</p>
<p>A research team led by Professor Dr. Zhi-Feng Huang from Wayne State University and Professor Löwen developed a multiscale theoretical model to describe the behavior of these odd crystals. Using this model, they performed simulations that revealed unexpected patterns and possible technological uses for these rotating materials.</p>
<p>Reversing the Rules of Crystal Growth</p>
<p>The team found that large crystals governed by transverse interactions tend to break down into smaller spinning units, while smaller crystals grow until reaching a specific critical size. This outcome runs counter to conventional crystal growth, where materials typically expand steadily under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>Professor Huang explains:&quot;We have discovered a fundamental property of nature underlying this process which determines the relation between the size of the critical fragments and their rotation speed.&quot;</p>
<p>Study co-author Professor Dr. Raphael Wittkowski of the DWI -- Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials and of RWTH Aachen University, adds: &quot;We furthermore demonstrated how defects in the crystals exhibit dynamics of their own. The formation of such defects can be influenced from outside, which allows properties of the crystals to be specifically controlled with a view to usage applications.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our far-reaching theory encompasses all systems evidencing such transverse interactions. Conceivable applications range from colloid research to biology,&quot; declares co-author Dr. Michael te Vrugt, Assistant Professor at the University of Mainz.</p>
<p>Professor Löwen adds: &quot;The model calculations indicate concrete application potential. The novel elastic properties of these new crystals could be exploited to invent new technical switching elements, for example.&quot;</p>
<p>In physics, interactions such as gravity and the Coulomb force are known as central forces because they act along the line connecting the centers of two bodies. These forces cause objects to move toward or away from each other.</p>

<div class='article'><h2> I asked Gemini to predict what the Apple M5 Ultra will look like - and the answer blew my mind away </h2>
<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/pro/i-asked-gemini-to-predict-what-the-apple-m5-ultra-will-look-like-and-the-answer-blew-my-mind-away'>Original</a></em></p>

<p>With great power comes great heat and energy demands</p>
<p>Apple recently announced its new M5 chip, along with the first products powered by the hardware - a 14-inch MacBook Pro, a new iPad Pro and an upgraded Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>The M5 includes a next-gen GPU with Neural Accelerators in each of its ten cores, allowing AI computations to run directly on the graphics hardware.</p>
<p>The M5 GPU can deliver over four times the peak compute performance for AI compared with the M4, while improving general graphics performance by about 45 percent.</p>
<p>The CPU, with up to ten cores divided between four performance and six efficiency cores, delivers around 15% faster multithreaded performance (there are actually two M5&#x27;s - the 256GB and 512GB iPad Pro models use a nine-core CPU with three performance cores).</p>
<p>Built on third-generation 3nm technology, the M5 maintains Apple&#x27;s unified memory structure that lets the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine share the same pool of memory, allowing data to move quickly between subsystems, cutting latency and power waste.</p>
<p>Frameworks such as Core ML and Metal benefit automatically from the added boost, meaning developers can see gains without changing their code.</p>
<p>Apple in-house processors have evolved quickly since the first M1 arrived in November 2020, and the new chip aligns perfectly with the American tech juggernaut&#x27;s current focus, where on-device Apple Intelligence plays an increasing role in tasks like image creation, LLM inference, and generative tools within apps.</p>
<p>These workloads now rely more heavily on the GPU and Neural Engine, both of which are more deeply integrated in M5.</p>
<p>But as Apple scales its silicon, cramming more cores and accelerators into compact devices such as MacBook Pro and iPad Pro, it faces inevitable thermal and power challenges.</p>
<p>Apple chips are efficient compared with many of its competitors, but each new generation brings smaller margins for cooling and power headroom.</p>
<p>This issue becomes clearer when looking at possible desktop versions of the M5 family.</p>
<p>This article is the first in a five-part series delving deep into Apple&#x27;s M-class processors, from the early M1 through to the newly announced M5 and our projected M5 Ultra. Each piece will explore how Apple&#x27;s silicon has evolved in architecture, performance, and design philosophy, and what those changes might mean for the company&#x27;s future hardware.</p>
<p>I asked Gemini, Google&#x27;s AI system, to model what an M5 Ultra might look like if Apple continued its usual scaling pattern.</p>
<p>According to Gemini&#x27;s estimates, an M5 Ultra could feature a maximum of 24 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores, and 80 GPU cores, along with up to 240 billion transistors and 1100GB/s memory bandwidth.</p>

<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/computing/internet/the-9-weirdest-things-that-happened-during-amazons-huge-aws-outage'>Original</a></em></p>

<p>When the internet breaks, unexpected things can happen</p>
<p>If you have a smartphone or are familiar with the internet, you may have noticed that things weren&#x27;t quite right yesterday - a huge AWS outage took out the hundreds of services that rely on its cloud computing backbone, and suddenly the digital world felt like it was made of jelly.</p>
<p>The impacts were serious and global, affecting over 1,000 businesses according to Downdetector. But what were some of the stranger glitches and unexpected consequences from the biggest Amazon Web Services outage we&#x27;ve seen for years?</p>
<p>To help give us all a little light relief from error messages and DNS-related nightmares, we&#x27;ve rounded up some of the weirder consequences (big and frivolous) from the biggest IT meltdown since Crowdstrike crashed the world&#x27;s business computers in 2024...</p>
<p>One of our favorite phrases from the AWS outage was Slack&#x27;s &#x27;Trouble with huddles&#x27;, which sounds like album by The National but instead described an IT incident that hit the messaging platform&#x27;s audio feature.</p>
<p>As spotted by The Verge, a Slack status update during the AWS blackout said that &quot;we&#x27;re currently investigating an issue where some users remain stuck in a huddle after attempting to leave&quot;.</p>
<p>Being stuck in a huddle usually wouldn&#x27;t be considered an unpleasant experience, but it&#x27;s slightly more serious in the context of Slack - given that it means being trapped in an audio call with a work colleague that you can&#x27;t leave.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the problem still isn&#x27;t fully fixed, with Slack saying today that it continues to &quot;work toward cleaning up any huddles that are in a bad state&quot;. The AWS outage at least showed that IT language can sometimes be unintentionally poetic.</p>
<p>The offside lines were drawn for the first time this season to rule out Thiago&#x27;s second goal for Brentford ❌There is no Semi-Automated Offside Technology available today due to the AWS outage 👀 pic.twitter.com/7vxv6fZ3CEOctober 20, 2025</p>
<p>Even the Premier League soccer wasn&#x27;t safe from the AWS outage. There was no old-school floodlight failure or ticket fiasco, but the problems did take out the Semi-Automated Offside Technology during Monday night&#x27;s match between West Ham and Brentford.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as Sky Sports noted above, that meant officials had to get their much-maligned rulers out again to see if Brentford&#x27;s second goal was offside or not. The human assistants decided it was offside, which predictably caused online outrage.</p>
<p>The Semi-Automated Offside Technology is run by a company called Genius Sports, which recently migrated its infrastructure to a typically safe pair of hands called Amazon Web Services. Unfortunately, this week AWS scored the equivalent of a huge own goal.</p>
<p>An outage that hits the Amazon.com homepage is a rarity, but now we know what to expect when it does go down - lots of dog photos.</p>
<p>At the peak of the AWS outage, Amazon&#x27;s own homepage was among the casualties, which left many unable to see their order histories - and thousands were also confronted with the error screen above.</p>
<p>Now, we&#x27;re not usually fans of twee error pages, but we did enjoy this one - Amazon&#x27;s page served up a number of different dog photos, all of which belong to Amazon workers.</p>
