            <div class="article-content">Republicans in North Carolina moved forward with a plan to redraw the state's congressional map and eliminate its only swing district. It's part of a GOP push to maintain control of Congress through maps that have the effect of diluting Black political power and diminishing the voting strength of communities of color. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

Republican lawmakers in North Carolina moved forward with a proposal today to redraw their state's congressional map in a way that would eliminate its only swing district.

The mid-decade redistricting is part of a nationwide push by President Trump and his Republican allies to help the GOP maintain control of Congress in next year's elections, often through maps that have the effect of diluting Black political power and diminishing the voting strength of communities of color.

Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court appeared willing to issue a ruling that could further that effort during arguments in a Louisiana redistricting case.

NAACP Legal Defense Fund president Janai Nelson argued the case before the court in defense of Louisiana voters, and she joins us now.

Janai Nelson, President and Director-Counsel, NAACP Legal Defense Fund: Thank you. Happy to be here.

So what was the main argument you presented before the court in defense of the existing Louisiana map that includes two majority-Black districts? What did you want the justices to understand about the stakes?

Well, I wanted the justices to understand that that map was remedying very flagrant violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and that, if for some reason, that map was not acceptable to them, that the proper recourse is to send it back to the lower courts, so that another map could be drawn that does remedy the racial discrimination that we proved in the case, and that what the court should not do is tinker with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, because it has been such a formidable protection and tool to advance our democracy.

And you just explained the many ways in which Black voters are often exploited or their votes are diluted for a variety of reasons, including sometimes partisan aims. And the Voting Rights Act, Section 2 in particular, is the only shield from that we can use with any expectation of real protection.

For the unfamiliar, what is Section 2 and what does it do?

So, Section 2 is part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It's a permanent provision of that act. And it basically says that there's no voting practice, procedure, qualification, anything having to do with voting that can abridge the right to vote, so deny it or dilute it or harm it in any way, minimize it, on account of race.

And, as we mentioned, North Carolina Republicans are moving forward with this plan to effectively oust one of the state's three Black members of Congress by carving up an area of Eastern North Carolina in this congressional map, and this district happens to have a large Black population.

So how does that square with what constitutes racial dilution under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act?

Well, it's pretty squarely a violation of the act, as far as I can tell. It is using Black voters as a means for gaining political power or partisan control.

And while the Supreme Court did say in another case, Rucho v. Common Cause, that it will not entertain any partisan gerrymandering claims, racial gerrymandering is still unlawful and it's still justiciable by the court, meaning that those claims are still viable before the court.</div>

Millions of people took to the streets throughout the country this weekend to protest President Donald Trump's agenda as the government shutdown enters its third full week with no clear resolution.

For more, we're joined by our Politics Monday duo. That's Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter and Tamara Keith of NPR.

It's always great to see you both.

Tamara Keith, National Public Radio:

Amy Walter, The Cook Political Report:

So, some seven million people, according to the organizers, they protested, demonstrated across some 2,500 cities. The president dismissed this weekend's massive protests. You see the images there from this past weekend. He dismissed them as a joke, saying that the people involved were not representative of the country.

Take a listen to what he had to say.

Donald Trump, President of the United States: I think it's a joke. I looked at the people. They're not representative of this country. And, by the way, I'm not a king. I'm not a king. I have worked my ass off to make our country great. That's all it is. I'm not a king at all.

Congratulations. They didn't burn any buildings down. That's a big achievement for the left to have some kind of gathering where they don't have looting and riots and burn a building down.

Again, some seven million people, 2,500 cities. This clearly aggravated him a little bit.

Yes. And part of President Trump's power in this second term has come from an air of invincibility, of inevitability, of having power and being able to use it.

And what these demonstrators showed, mostly what they showed each other, is that they aren't alone and that there are people who actually do oppose the president. He has - by sort of saying, ah, this isn't a big deal and all of that, he is - and also putting out a video, an A.I.-altered - or not altered, an A.I.-created video of himself flying a fighter jet with a crown on his head, much like a king, dropping what looks like excrement on protesters, he's trying to downplay something that is real and is a part of America.

Obviously, it's not all of America. It's not his part of America. He has repeatedly, by - during the government shutdown, for instance, saying, I'm going to defund Democrat things and Democrat states, to use the phrasing that he has used, he is essentially saying he's president for a different America.

And, Amy, it's not at all surprising that the president would dismiss these protests.</div>

WASHINGTON (AP) - Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey urged a judge Monday to dismiss the case against him, calling it a vindictive prosecution motivated by "personal animus" and orchestrated by a White House determined to seek retribution against a perceived foe of President Donald Trump.

The lawyers separately called for the indictment's dismissal because of what they said was the illegitimate appointment of the U.S. attorney who filed the case days after being hastily named to the job by Trump.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.

The two-prong attack on the indictment, which accuses Comey of lying to Congress five years ago, represents the opening salvo in what is expected to be a protracted court fight ahead of a trial currently set for Jan. 5. The motions take aim not at the substance of the allegations but rather on the unusual circumstances of the prosecution, which included Trump exhorting his attorney general to bring charges against Comey as well as his administration's abrupt installation of a White House aide to serve as top prosecutor of the elite office overseeing the case.

"Bedrock principles of due process and equal protection have long ensured that government officials may not use courts to punish and imprison their perceived personal and political enemies," wrote Comey's defense team, which includes Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. Attorney in Chicago and a longtime Comey friend. "But that is exactly what happened here."

They said the Justice Department had brought the case because of Trump's hatred of Comey, who as FBI director in the first months of Trump's first term infuriated the president through his oversight of an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump fired Comey in May 2017. The two have been open adversaries in the years since, with Comey labeling Trump "unethical" and comparing him to a mafia boss and Trump branding Comey an "untruthful slimeball" and calling for him to be punished because of the Russia investigation.

"The government has singled out Mr. Comey for prosecution because of his protected speech and because of President Trump's personal animus toward Mr. Comey," defense lawyers wrote, adding that such a "vindictive and selection prosecution" violates multiple provisions of the Constitution and must be dismissed.

Comey's defense team had foreshadowed the arguments during his first and only court appearance in the case, where he pleaded not guilty.

Though motions alleging vindictive prosecutions do not often succeed, this one lays out a timeline of events intended to link Trump's demands for a prosecution with the Justice Department's scramble to secure an indictment last month just before the statute of limitations was set to lapse.

Last month, for instance, he complained in a Truth Social post directed to Attorney General Pam Bondi that "nothing is being done" on investigations into some of his foes and called for action, specifically referencing inquiries into Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.

"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!" part of the message said.

He installed Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who had been one of Trump's personal lawyers but had no experience as a federal prosecutor, to run the Eastern District of Virginia and replace Erik Siebert, who had resigned as U.S. attorney one day earlier amid administration pressure to charge Comey and James. Comey was indicted days later.</div>

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent's rich rare-earth resources when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.

The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.

"In about a year from now we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won't know what to do with them," said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. "They'll be worth $2."

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.

Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship "to the next level."

Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.

"Australia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we're seeing from the Chinese," Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump's meeting with Albanese.

Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.

The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years - if not decades - to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce their dominance.

Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.

For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.

"Taking away that arrow of China's to be able to manipulate pricing is a crucial first step for Australia and the West to be able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our demands," said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.

The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China's influence.</div>

PETERSBURG, Va. (AP) - Rae Pickett stepped onto Richell Hines' front stoop wearing a pink T-shirt that foretold the case she hoped to make to Virginia voters as she knocked on doors on a sunny Saturday in early October.

"Abortion is on the ballot," it read.

Hines answered Pickett's knock on her Petersburg, Virginia, door with a disarming smile and a T-shirt of her own: "She who kneels before God can stand before anyone."

The polite exchange that followed between Pickett and Hines revealed the complexity of one of the most vivid policy differences between the two women vying to be the first female governor of Virginia - Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. The winner will likely influence abortion law in the only Southern state that's maintained broad access to abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 eliminated a national right to the procedure.

Spanberger, a former congresswoman, supports a proposed state constitutional amendment that'll reach voters only if Democrats maintain their House of Delegates majority. Earle-Sears, Virginia's lieutenant governor, has been an outspoken abortion rights opponent throughout her political career.

Both candidates have cast the other as an outlier on abortion. But they're also focusing on other matters, like Spanberger's emphasis on the economy and Earle-Sears' opposition to transgender people's rights.

Pickett, who works for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, specifically went to the homes of voters who hadn't yet cast ballots in a Democratic-leaning neighborhood. She quickly encouraged those who answered to vote. If those folks backed Democrats in the competitive House of Delegates district - regardless of their reasoning - she knew they were effectively voting for abortion rights, too.

"I do understand in some circumstances it's needed and others it's preventable," Hines said when asked her views on abortion.

She added, sighing: "That's a hard one."

Nationally, advocates across the abortion rights spectrum are watching Virginia for clues about how the issue might resonate in 2026 midterm campaigns, with control of Congress and dozens of statehouses at stake.

"We know that the elections here signal what the tone and temperature could be in other elections going forward," said Olivia Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, which opposes abortion rights.

About 6 in 10 Virginia voters in the 2024 presidential election said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters. More than half of Virginia voters said they'd oppose banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy nationwide. Slightly fewer than half said they'd favor such a restriction.

Polling also indicates most people believe abortion should be allowed in some circumstances but not others, roughly in line with national numbers: 62% of U.S. voters last November said abortion should be legal in at least "most" cases.</div>
