World Cup Westmont - Day Three Prelims: Gretchen Walsh Closes in on Another Record Swim

The final day of the World Cup stop in Westmont will unfold on Sunday, with the series then shifting to Toronto for its final leg. Action in the Chicago suburbs has been sensational, highlighted on Saturday night by world records from Mollie O'Callaghan in the 200-meter freestyle and Regan Smith in the 100 backstroke.

During the Sunday morning prelims, O'Callaghan will be back in the water for the 100 freestyle and Smith will race the 200 backstroke. On the men's side, Canadian Ilya Kharun has enjoyed a strong first two days in Westmont, claiming victories in the 50 freestyle and 200 butterfly. He's now set to contest the 50 butterfly, an event he won last week in Carmel.

Here is an event-by-event recap of the Day Three prelims:

The 400 IM is a timed final at the World Cup so the fastest heat based on entry times will swim in the finals.

In the earlier heats, Australia's Brendon Smith was the fastest of the morning, getting to the wall in 4:07.36.

Lucas Henveaux followed with a 4:08.56.

There was an 11-second gap from Henveaux to the rest of the field.

World record holder Gretchen Walsh took the top seed in the 100 fly, predictably, in 54.28. The time is less than a second off the World Cup record she swam last week in Carmel.

Her world record time is 52.71.

Australia's Alex Perkins took the second seed in 56.01, ahead of Belgium's Roos VanOtterdijk (56.90) and Finland's Laura Lahtinen (56.92), who all broke 57 seconds.

Australia's Olivia Wunsch took the fifth seed in 57.10, followed by Ireland's Ellen Walshe (57.43), New Zealand's Vanessa Ouwehand (57.75) and Australia's Brittany Castelluzzo (58.00).

Canada's Ilya Kharun put together a strong back-half of the race to touch the wall in 22.04 and take the top seed.

World Record holder Noe Ponti from Switzerland took the second seed in 22.18. He holds the World Cup record at 21.50 and the world record (SCM) in 21.32.

Finlay Brooks took the third seed in 22.22, followed by Canada's Josh Liendo (22.23), Singapore's Tzen Wei Teong (22.44), Trinidad and Tobago's Dylan Carter (22.62) - and a tie for the seventh seed with Ralf Tribuntsov and Simone Stefani at 22.63.

World record holder Regan Smith grabbed the top seed in the 200 backstroke, but not by much, and the field looks to bring perhaps the most interesting final tonight.

Smith took the top seed in 2:03.12 - four seconds off her World Cup record and nearly five off her world record - but it was just one hundredth of a second ahead of Miranda Grana (2:03.13) and that doesn't include Olympic medalists Phoebe Bacon (2:03.55) and Kaylee McKeown (2:03.77) looming.

Australia's Hannah Fredericks took the fifth spot in 2:03.99, followed by Anastasiya Shkurdai (2:04.23), Canada's Madison Kryger (2:04.62) and USA's Rhyan White (2:04.81).

Hungary's Hubert Kos was out strong and hung on to take the top seed in the 100 backstroke, getting to the wall in 50.22.

Canada's Finlay Knox was also sub-51, turning in a time of 50.85.

Australia's Enoch Robb was just behind with a 51.02, followed by Kacper Stokowski (51.06), Italy's Thomas Ceccon (51.13), Miroslav Knedla (51.28), Poland's Ksawery Masiuk (51.34) and Grant Bochenski (51.61).

Belgium's Florine Gaspard took a narrow lead into the turn and held on to take the top seed 29.79.

Ireland's Mona McSharry was just behind in 29.91, also under 30 seconds.

Canada's Sophie Angus took the third seed (30.16), Skyler Smith (30.22), Israel's Anastasia Gorbenko (30.29), Hungary's Henrietta Fangli (30.48), Emelie Fast (30.48) and Japan's Satomi Suzuki (30.56).

Caspar Corbeau of the Netherlands took the top seed by more than a second, getting to the wall in 2:04.07.

David Schlicht took the second spot in 2:05.37, followed by USA's Josh Matheny (2:05.63).

Spain's Carles Coll Marti took fourth in 2:05.72, followed by a trio of Japanese swimmers - Shin Ohashi (2:05.95), Ippel Watanabe (2:05.97) and Yamato Fukasawa (2:06.20).

Ilya Shymanovich took the last finals spot in 2:06.49, just ahead of Great Britain's Adam Peaty (2:06.96).

USA's Kate Douglass took the top seed in the 100 free, cruising to the wall in 51.27 after an opening 50 of 24.39.

Australia's Olivia Wunsch was a second behind at 52.26, followed by strong race from Canadian Olympian Taylor Ruck (52.30).

Marrit Steenbergen of the Netherlands took the fourth spot in 52.35, ahead of Polish Olympic medalist Kasia Wasick (52.41) and Italy's Sarah Curtis (52.43).

Australia's Mollie O'Callaghan took the seventh spot in 52.49 and USA's Anna Peplowski rounded out the finalists in 52.71.

USA's Chris Guiliano battled his way to the top seed with a 1:42.13 as just a second was the difference between spots 1-8.

Great Britain's Matthew Richards took the second seed in 1:42.38, ahead of USA's Luke Hobson (1:42.55). Hobson set the world record (SCM) in the event last year in Budapest.

Belgium's Lucas Henveaux took the fourth seed in 1:42.59, followed by USA's Patrick Sammon (1:42.76), Grant House (1:42.84), Brooks Curry (1:43.09) and Kieran Smith (1:43.16).

South Africa's Rebecca Meder claimed the top spot in the 200 IM, getting to the wall in 2:07.58.

USA's Alex Walsh took the second spot in 2:08.11, ahead of Israel's Anastasia Gorbenko (2:08.37), Great Britain's Abbie Wood (2:08.49), USA's Phoebe Bacon (2:08.82), while Japan's Mio Narita (2:09.00), Ireland's Ellen Walshe (2:09.01) and GB's Freya Colbert (2:09.26) rounded out the top eight.
