<p>Jannik Sinner was world number one until losing the US Open final to Carlos Alcaraz in September</p>
<p>Four-time Grand Slam champion Jannik Sinner will not be part of the Italy team aiming to clinch a third consecutive Davis Cup title next month.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old reached all four Grand Slam singles finals in 2025, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and won the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Saudi Arabia on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sinner is scheduled to take part in the ATP Tour Finals in Turin from 9-16 November, but Italy captain Filippo Volandri said the world number two had &quot;not given his availability&quot; to play at the Davis Cup in Bologna from 18-23 November.</p>
<p>World number one Carlos Alcaraz has been named in Spain&#x27;s team.</p>

<p>&#x27;Sport must adapt&#x27;, says Draper after Rune injury</p>
<p>Sinner says he has taken the decision to miss the Davis Cup so he can have extra preparation time for the start of next season, with the Australian Open being the first Grand Slam of the year in January.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t an easy decision, but after Turin, the goal is to get off on the right foot in Australia,&quot; Sinner told Sky Sport Italy. &quot;It may not seem like it, but a week of preparation during that period can make all the difference.</p>
<p>&quot;We won the Davis Cup in 2023 and 2024, and this time we decided this with my team.&quot;</p>
<p>Lorenzo Musetti and Flavio Cobolli, eighth and 22nd in the world respectively, will be the highest-ranked singles players on show for Italy, who face Austria in their quarter-final.</p>
<p>Volandri said: &quot;The Davis Cup is, and will remain, always his home and I am sure that Jannik will soon be part of the team again.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime, I can count on a group ready to fight and give everything for the blue jersey.&quot;</p>
<p>Sinner&#x27;s absence comes after several players voiced concerns about a demanding tennis calendar in recent weeks.</p>
<p>After Holger Rune sustained a season-ending injury at the Nordic Open on Saturday, British number one Jack Draper posted on social media that &quot;the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity&quot;.</p>

<p>Nineteen of Daniil Medvedev&#x27;s 21 titles have been won on hard courts</p>
<p>A resurgent Daniil Medvedev claimed his first title for 882 days with victory over Corentin Moutet in the Almaty Open final.</p>
<p>The Russian former world number one has had a torrid year, winning just one match at the Grand Slams and suffering a meltdown at the US Open.</p>
<p>Medvedev&#x27;s inconsistency on the ATP Tour - and struggles with his serve in particular - led to him dropping out of the world&#x27;s top 10 and ultimately splitting with long-time coach Gilles Cervara.</p>
<p>Now working with Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke, Medvedev has steadily improved in the past month - culminating in a hard-fought 7-5 4-6 6-3 victory over Frenchman Moutet.</p>
<p>It is Medvedev&#x27;s first title since the 2023 Rome Masters and first on a hard court since March of that year.</p>
<p>Victory also means Medvedev has won 21 titles at 21 different tournaments.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m at a tournament with my two daughters together, so to get a title is really nice,&quot; said world number 14 Medvedev.</p>
<p>&quot;This title is in honour of my second daughter, Victoria, because the first title I got when my first daughter Alisa was born was for her.&quot;</p>

<p>Sinner dominates Alcaraz at lucrative Six Kings Slam</p>
<p>Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion, had lost his past six finals, including in Halle earlier this year.</p>
<p>His defensive play style and frequent outbursts on court had led some to wonder if his ability to compete at the top level was over.</p>
<p>But the 29-year-old has made changes in recent weeks, making an effort to come to the net and play aggressively, backed up by an improved serve.</p>

<p>Jannik Sinner claimed a commanding victory over rival Carlos Alcaraz to win the lucrative Six Kings Slam in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Sinner, replaced as world number one by Alcaraz following the US Open in September, exacted revenge for his defeat in the New York final with a 6-2 6-4 win.</p>
<p>While the pair split the four Grand Slam titles between them this season, Sinner was dominant from the outset against Alcaraz, who said his opponent was &quot;just too good&quot; on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sinner broke Alcaraz&#x27;s serve in the opening game and swiftly wrapped up the first set, with the Spaniard unable to gain a foothold against his opponent&#x27;s clinical serving.</p>
<p>He would go on to win the exhibition event for the second consecutive year after making the decisive breakthrough in the seventh game of the second set.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could play like this everywhere,&quot; Sinner said in his on-court interview.</p>
<p>&quot;This season we played many, many times and I also lost many times to Carlos. It is a huge pleasure and honour to share the court with him.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very special friendship and it&#x27;s very nice.&quot;</p>

<p>Rating Raducanu&#x27;s season - and what does future hold?</p>
<p>Six of the world&#x27;s top men&#x27;s players competed at the three-day exhibition event in Saudi Arabia, which was streamed on Netflix.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has been accused of using its investment in sports and high-profile events to improve its image - known as &#x27;sportswashing&#x27; - amid criticism over its human rights record.</p>
<p>Alcaraz beat Taylor Fritz in straight sets to reach the final and Sinner overpowered joint-record 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic, who withdrew from his third-place play-off after losing the first set against Fritz earlier on Saturday.</p>
<p>Together, Sinner and Alcaraz have won nine of the sport&#x27;s past 10 majors and met in each of the last three slam finals in the early years of a burgeoning rivalry which has gripped the sport.</p>

<p>British number one Jack Draper says the tennis calendar must be adapted after Holger Rune became the latest high-profile player to have his season ended prematurely.</p>
<p>Danish 22-year-old Rune, set to return to the world&#x27;s top 10 after reaching the semi-finals at the Nordic Open in Stockholm, was forced to retire with injury when leading Frenchman Ugo Humbert by a set.</p>
<p>Rune&#x27;s mother, Aneke, later told Danish newspaper BT that she had been informed by medical staff that her son&#x27;s injury was &quot;very bad&quot;.</p>
<p>She said: &quot;They are completely sure that it is a torn Achilles tendon, so it&#x27;s of course very bad. Holger is completely devastated. They say they can see it with the naked eye.&quot;</p>
<p>Draper wrote on X: &quot;Injuries are going to happenâ¦ we are pushing our bodies to do things they aren&#x27;t supposed to in elite sport.</p>
<p>&quot;We have so many incredible younger guys on the tour right now and I&#x27;m proud to be a part of that.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity.&quot;</p>
<p>Rune, nursing a hamstring issue coming into the match, appeared instantly aware of the severity of his injury and was emotional as he received treatment after hobbling to his chair.</p>
<p>He had pulled up in pain after jumping to hit a ball at the back of the court, with the game level at 40-40 on Humbert&#x27;s serve and Rune leading 6-4 2-2.</p>
<p>Humbert said: &quot;It was not the way I wanted to win. I&#x27;m super disappointed for Holger, I hope he is going to be OK.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish him a speedy recovery. It was a great match, he was playing a little bit better than me, but I&#x27;m really sorry for Holger.&quot;</p>
<p>Later on Saturday, Novak Djokovic also retired after losing the first set of his third-place play-off against Taylor Fritz at the Six Kings Slam in Saudi Arabia - an exhibition event - having struggled with injury and sickness at last week&#x27;s Shanghai Masters.</p>
<p>Carlos Alcaraz, who finished runner-up to Jannik Sinner at the Saudi Arabia event which is not part of the ATP Tour, criticised the congested tennis calendar in September, saying &quot;they are going to kill us in some way&quot;.</p>
<p>Naomi Osaka became the latest high-profile player to withdraw from a tournament because of injury when she pulled out of the Japan Open with a leg problem before her quarter-final on Friday.</p>
<p>Former women&#x27;s world number one Iga Swiatek complained in September that the season is &quot;too long and too intense&quot; amid a string of injuries among players at the China Open.</p>

<p>Naomi Osaka&#x27;s last Grand Slam trophy came at the Australian Open in 2021</p>
<p>Naomi Osaka has pulled out of the Japan Open before Friday&#x27;s quarter-final because of a leg injury sustained in the second round.</p>
<p>The former world number one held back tears and needed painkillers to come through a three-set last-16 win over defending champion Suzan Lamens on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Top seed Osaka, who completed the match with strapping on her left thigh, was due to face Jaqueline Cristian in the last eight but the Romanian will instead progress to the semi-finals.</p>
<p>The Japan Open made the announcement on X, saying: &quot;We regret to announce that Naomi Osaka has not recovered from a left leg injury sustained during the second round of this tournament and has withdrawn from the quarter-finals scheduled for today.&quot;</p>
<p>It is not yet known whether Osaka will play in the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo later this month.</p>
<p>The four-time Grand Slam champion is the latest high-profile player to suffer late-season injury or health issues.</p>
<p>In September, Iga Swiatek complained the season is &quot;too long and too intense&quot; following a string of injuries among players at the China Open.</p>
<p>British number one Emma Raducanu called time on her season on Thursday after retiring from her two previous matches with illness.</p>
<p>Australia&#x27;s Daria Kasatkina, Ukraine&#x27;s Elina Svitolina and Spain&#x27;s Paula Badosa also ended their seasons early in recent weeks, citing either injury or a pressing need to take a break from the tour.</p>
<p>Across two tournaments in China last week, five players retired injured.</p>
