    "description": "Chancellors rarely reveal tax plans before the Budget, but Reeves has softened her language on raising income tax.",
    "pub_date": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 16:55:49 GMT",
    "content": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has refused to rule out an income tax rise in next month's Budget, amid speculation she is considering breaking a key Labour election pledge.\n\nAsked about reports, first published in The Guardian newspaper, that the Treasury is in active discussions over raising the rate, Reeves said she would \"continue to support working people by keeping their taxes as low as possible\".\n\nReeves' refusal to rule out a rise does not mean one is inevitable as Chancellors rarely confirm or deny specific tax measures ahead of a Budget.\n\nBut her careful language contrasts with comments in September that \"manifesto commitments stand\" on not raising income tax, National Insurance or VAT.\n\nLabour's 2024 general election manifesto contained a pledge not to raise \"the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax\".\n\nThe party also promised not to increase National Insurance - prompting a row last autumn when it announced a hike in the contributions paid by employers.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Leeds on Friday, Reeves said: \"Although I can't talk about individual measures at this stage, I understand that the cost of living is still people's number one concern.\"\n\nShe went on to say that her aim was to \"ensure that we continue to support working people by keeping their taxes as low as possible\" but that she was still \"going through the process\" of writing her Budget.\n\nShe also said that although the inflation figures this week \"came in better than expected\" there was \"obviously much more to do.\"\n\nThe chancellor has signalled she is likely to focus on wealthy individuals at the Budget, saying \"those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share\".\n\nHowever, economists say such steps will not raise enough to close the hole in the government's finances, leaving Reeves under pressure to consider more politically sensitive options.\n\nInfluential think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says Reeves will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes to make up a \u00a322bn shortfall in the government's finances.\n\nThe effective interest rates on UK government debt has fallen sharply, but Reeves has been left with very little room to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules without increasing taxes.\n\nThese rules mean her plans must be projected to get government debt falling as a share of national income by 2029-30, and day-to-day government costs must be paid for by tax income rather than borrowing.\n\nCurrently, Income tax is charged on earnings above the personal allowance of \u00a312,570, which is tax-free.",

    "content": "Tech giants including Apple, Samsung and Google are not doing enough to stop mobile phone thefts, MPs on the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee have said.\n\nIn a letter to the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, committee chair Chi Onwurah accused the companies of failing to put in place technical measures that would make stolen phones less valuable.\n\nThe letter follows a stormy committee hearing, where MPs accused tech bosses of profiting from phone thefts.\n\nResponding to the letter, Google said it had \"invested in advanced theft protection features\" including the theft detection lock after \"listening to victims and partnering closely with law enforcement and industry\".\n\nApple and Samsung have also been contacted for comment.\n\nWriting to Mahmood, Onwurah said that during the hearing in June, the committee had sought to \"answer the question: Is there a way to design out phone theft?\"\n\n\"The answer, in the view of the committee, is yes.\"\n\nThe problem of mobile phone thefts is particularly prevalent in London where, in 2024, 80,000 smartphones were reported as stolen - up from 64,000 in 2023.\n\nStolen devices are blocked from being used in the UK by phone networks by using the phone's unique identifying number - known as an IMEI - but this is not the case globally.\n\nOnwurah argued that \"robust technical measures\" such as blocking stolen phones taken overseas from accessing cloud services could make devices \"far less valuable\".\n\nShe also pointed to comments by Mobile UK, the trade association of the UK's mobile network operators, who said blocking IMEI in other countries was a \"necessary step to dismantle the business model of organised crime\".\n\nHowever, she said when giving evidence, Apple, Google and Samsung had avoided saying why they would not implement the technology.\n\n\"Their repeated pivots to answering questions about data security rather than devices, and insistence that the phones were broken down and sold for parts, without any evidence to support this assertion, was telling,\" she said.\n\n\"Technology to deter phone theft is available, and we have yet to hear a convincing reason why, with co-operation on all sides, the available solutions shouldn't be used to disincentivise phone theft and disrupt the market in stolen devices.\"\n\nOnwurah asked the home secretary if she would push the tech giants to implement cloud-based blocking and also pressed the minister to provide a data for the next phone theft summit.",

It's going to be - as they say - absolute scenes in there. Let the yelling commence.\"\n\nCottrell-Boyce and two other adult judges will select a shortlist of eight books, with three children then joining to help choose the winning book.\n\nGaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation, said: \"The Children's Booker Prize is the most ambitious endeavour we've embarked on in 20 years - and we hope its impact will resonate for decades to come.\"\n\nAt least 30,000 copies of the shortlisted and winning books will be gifted to children.\n\nWood said the award aimed to \"champion future classics\" and was also designed \"to inspire more young people to read\".\n\n\"This prize will make books more available for a lot of kids,\" he said, adding it was also \"going to really ignite a conversation\".\n\nOther authors and previous Children's Laureates who have welcomed the announcement included Dame Jacqueline Wilson, who said it was \"a marvellous idea\".\n\nFellow children's author Anne Fine said: \"When it comes to book prizes, we all say, The More The Merrier [in a nod to her book of the same name], and especially when it comes to writing for children, which has all too often been the overlooked Cinderella of the book world.\"\n\nAs with the Booker Prize and International Booker Prize, the shortlisted authors will each receive \u00a32,500 and the winning author \u00a350,000.\n\nThe prize will accept submissions from publishers in spring 2026, when the remaining two adult judges will be announced.\n\nThe shortlist of eight books - and the three child judges - will be revealed in November next year, while the winner will be announced at an event for young readers in February 2027.\n\nThe prize will be open to global authors for books written originally in English and for those translated into English, as long as they are published in the UK or Ireland between 1 November 2025 and 31 October 2026.",

    "content": "A gallery attendant on duty at the Louvre when thieves broke in and stole eight of France's crown jewels has said \"no-one could have been prepared\" for what unfolded as visitors began to arrive on Sunday morning.\n\n\"All of a sudden we heard an huge noise,\" she told radio station France Inter, in the first account given by an attendant at the scene.\n\nThe unnamed attendant and two colleagues initially thought the noise to be an angry visitor, but it was not a normal sound: \"It was a dull, slightly metallic noise.\"\n\nIt was, in fact, the moment thieves had used an angle grinder to burst through a reinforced window into the Gallery of Apollo, where the Louvre's collection of historic jewelry is kept.\n\nWithin eight minutes, the gang seized treasures, including a necklace that belonged to Napoleon's wife Empress Marie-Louise and a diadem of Napoleon III's wife Empress Eugenie, worth an estimated total of \u20ac88m (\u00a377m).\n\nThe thieves used a mechanical ladder on the back of a lorry to lift them to a first-floor balcony to gain entry to the gallery.\n\nTwo tourists ran towards them in panic, she said.\n\n\"I saw one of the criminals turn around with something that looked to me like a chainsaw, then I yelled at my colleagues to get out,\" she recalled. She shouted a second time that it was a robbery and that they should run.\n\nOne of her colleagues raised the alarm over a walkie-talkie and then \"we finished evacuating the visits without quite realising really what was going on\". They shut all the doors as they left to protect the neighbouring galleries.\n\nOn reflection, the attendant said \"for us it was unbelievable the display cases could have been broken... never for a moment did we think there was such a risk... nobody can be prepared for that\".\n\nAnother Louvre employee came forward to describe the moments after the gang escaped.\n\nThe anonymous security guard spoke of a very strong smell of petrol as he arrived at the scene outside the Louvre where the gang had parked their lorry.\n\n\"I ran outside through the [glass] pyramid and across the courtyard... I got there at the very moment the criminals got away by scooter,\" he told BFMTV.\n\nThe gang had ruptured the lorry's fuel tank and there was a blowtorch near by, he said. \"It's clear they intended to set fire to their vehicle. I genuinely think we thwarted their plan because they would never have left behind so much evidence.\"\n\n\"They even lost one of the pieces they'd meant to steal, because they'd lost [Empress] Eugenie's crown, which they'd just stolen and it had fallen on the ground.\"",

    "pub_date": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 19:10:15 GMT",
    "content": "The UK and US have in recent days sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies, while the EU targeted Moscow's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was also in London, said \"pressure\" on Russia was the only way to stop the fighting. However, no long-range missile deliveries to Ukraine were announced at the summit.\n\nZelensky has long argued that US-made Tomahawks and European missiles would help make the war costs heavier for Moscow by hitting key military targets - including oil refineries and weapons depots - deep inside Russia.\n\nBut during last week's talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump indicated to Zelensky that he was not ready to supply Tomahawks.\n\nOn Thursday, President Putin warned that if \"such weapons are used to strike Russian Federation territory the response will be... overwhelming\".\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference after the London summit, Starmer said Putin was \"not serious about peace\", and therefore Ukraine's allies agreed a \"clear plan for the rest of the year\" on supporting Ukraine.\n\nThe UK prime minister said this also included targeting Russia's sovereign assets to \"unlock billions to help finance Ukraine's defence\". He gave no further details.\n\nOn Thursday, EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years - but stopped short of agreeing to use frozen Russian assets worth \u20ac140bn (\u00a3122bn).\n\nAsked about a so-called \"reparations loan\" for Ukraine funded by the Russian assets, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she hoped a decision would be made by Christmas Eve\n\nIn London, the \"coalition of the willing\" also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defences\" amid almost daily Russian air assaults on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure.\n\nZelensky warned that Russia \"wants to make the winter cold a tool of torment\", adding that \"they want to break us\".\n\nComments by the leaders in London will be disappointing for those who were hoping to hear specific examples of how Ukraine's allies were planning to make Russia stop attacking Ukraine.\n\nNo doubt, a lot of the words said will be pleasing to the Ukrainian ear. For example, Starmer said the UK and Ukraine's other allies were prepared to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.\n\nBut there were no concrete examples of how exactly the allies were planning to force a change on the battlefield or make Putin come to the negotiating table.",

She accused the prince of sexually assaulting her - allegations Prince Andrew has strenuously denied.\n\nPrince Andrew's banner, which he was given when he became a Knight of the Garter (KG) in 2006, had been hanging in the quire - the area where clergy and the choir sit for services.\n\nA virtual tour of the area available on the website for St George's Chapel shows it still hanging near the door leading into the quire. It is not known when the tour was created.\n\nHowever, the banner has now been removed and only three now hang in the space. It is thought it was taken down earlier in the week.\n\nThe Order of the Garter is the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain and includes other senior members of the royal family and those said to have contributed notably to public life.\n\nCurrent non-royal members include former prime ministers Sir Tony Blair and Sir John Major.\n\nPrince Andrew is facing scrutiny over his Royal Lodge home in Windsor Great Park, where he has paid a \"peppercorn rent\" for more than 20 years.\n\nThe government this week refused to give MPs time to debate Prince Andrew's titles or taxpayer-funded home, despite growing pressure for scrutiny.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about Ms Giuffre through his police protection.\n\nPrince Andrew has also removed his royal titles from Companies House, changing his name from \"HRH the Duke of York KG\" to \"Prince Andrew.\" A document was filed listing a change of his details for his start up venture Pitch@Palace.\n\nOn 17 October, Andrew said he would stop using the titles because the \"continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family\".\n\n\"I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\" he said.",

Canadian officials remain ready to continue talks to reduce tariffs in certain sectors, he said.\n\n\"We can't control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,\" Carney said Friday morning before boarding a flight to Asia. \"We have to focus on what we can control and realize what we can't control.\"\n\nCarney is trying to secure a trade deal with Trump, but tariffs are taking a toll in the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors.\n\nCarney spoke to Ford Thursday night and again Friday.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said talks with Canada have not led to any constructive progress.",

Charles and Judith Voorhees asked a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order to stop further destruction to the mansion, saying the project moved forward \"without legally required approvals or reviews.\"\n\nSeveral preservation groups have expressed concern in recent weeks about the project, which is the first major change to the exterior of the White House in 83 years. Collectively, their separate statements said a more transparent and thorough review process was needed before the ballroom project got underway.\n\nCommunication about how the ballroom project would affect the main structure of the building was confusing from the beginning, said Priya Jain, chair of the Society of Architectural Historians' Heritage Conservation Committee.\n\n\"There was kind of an ambiguity about the way things were framed from the get-go,\" she said, adding that the society's letter asked for more clarification and transparency around the White House's statements, given the mansion is a highly significant historical building.\n\nThank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.\n\nIn remarks to reporters last week, Trump said that two unnamed advisors had told him he could start the ballroom construction immediately, forgoing any oversight or zoning. He said the advisors told him, \"Sir, this is the White House. You're the president of the United States.\n\nIn flattening the East Wing of the White House, \"we lose a significant piece of history,\" author Kate Andersen Brower said.\n\nThe wing, which was originally constructed in 1902 and renovated in 1942, served as the public entrance to the White House, and housed the family movie theater as well as offices on legislative affairs, the military and the in-house calligraphers. Perhaps most prominently, though, it included office space for the first lady and her aides.\n\nFor Brower, who wrote \"The Residence\" about daily life inside the White House and \"First Women\" about the role of modern first ladies, what has happened to the East Wing \"speaks a lot to how diminished the role of the president's spouse has become.\"\n\n\"Truly, the power center in the White House is always the Oval Office and the West Wing, and proximity to the Oval Office is so important,\" she added. \"If you have the first lady and her staff working out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which I think is what will likely happen, they're even more removed from the center of power. I mean, the East Wing has been called 'Siberia' as a joke inside the White House.\n\nPresident Barack Obama with Melissa Winter, an aide to first lady Michelle Obama, in the East Wing, March 2009.

    "description": "Scientists have unveiled Khankhuuluu, a new Mongolian dinosaur species that predates and closely resembles early Tyrannosaurs. With its long snout, small horns, and lean build, it represents a transitional form between swift mid-sized predators and giant apex hunters like T. rex. The find also suggests that large Tyrannosaurs first evolved in North America following an ancient migration from Asia.",
    "pub_date": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:01:07 EDT",
    "content": "An international team of paleontologists has identified a previously unknown dinosaur species named Khankhuuluu, believed to be the closest-known ancestor of the giant Tyrannosaurs. The discovery, led by Jared Voris and Dr. Darla Zelenitsky from the University of Calgary's Faculty of Science, has been published in Nature.\n\nVoris, a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth, Energy, and Environment, explains that this newly identified Tyrannosaur lived about 86 million years ago. It was a medium-sized, fast-moving predator that evolved after the extinction of other large carnivorous dinosaurs.\n\nA Glimpse Into Tyrannosaur Evolution\n\nAccording to Voris, \"This new species provides us the window into the ascent stage of Tyrannosaur evolution; right when they're transitioning from small predators to their apex predator form.\" Khankhuuluu is regarded as the nearest known ancestor of the colossal Tyrannosaurs popularized by films like Jurassic Park.\n\nThe name Khankhuuluu comes from Mongolian and translates to \"prince of dragons\" or \"the dragon prince.\" The name reflects its position in the Tyrannosaur family tree -- standing as the \"prince\" before the \"king,\" Tyrannosaurus rex. At roughly 750 kilograms (about the size of a horse), it was two to three times smaller than its enormous descendants but shared many of their defining traits.\n\nPhysical Traits and Hunting Style\n\nKhankhuuluu displayed small horn-like structures on its head, features that later became more pronounced in later Tyrannosaur species such as Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus, likely used for mating displays or intimidation. Its long, shallow skull indicates it lacked the bone-crushing bite strength of T. rex. Instead, scientists describe Khankhuuluu as a mesopredator, similar to modern coyotes, relying on speed and agility to hunt.\n\nFossils From Mongolia Tell a New Story\n\nThe fossils were unearthed from the Bayanshiree Formation in southeastern Mongolia and were first studied in the 1970s by paleontologist Altangerel Perle, who initially compared them to a similar species known as Alectrosaurus from China. When Voris examined the fossils in 2023 at the Institute of Paleontology in Mongolia, he noticed subtle but key differences that distinguished them from Alectrosaurus.\n\nThe Journey of Tyrannosaurs Between Continents\n\nDr. Zelenitsky explains that Khankhuuluu or a closely related species likely migrated from Asia to North America around 85 million years ago.\"Our study provides solid evidence that large Tyrannosaurs first evolved in North America as a result of this immigration event,\" she says.\n\nThe research suggests these migrations between Asia and North America were rarer and more limited than previously believed. Khankhuuluu appears to be the last known Asian ancestor of the Tyrannosaurs before their diversification in North America.\n\nFrom the \"Dragon Prince\" to the Tyrant King\n\nScientists believe that Khankhuuluu, or one of its relatives, crossed a land bridge into North America, where it evolved into the formidable apex predator Tyrannosaurs. Fossil evidence shows that Tyrannosaurs thrived in North America for several million years before returning to Asia, where their lineage split into two branches: one evolved into massive predators like T. rex, while the other produced more slender, long-snouted types nicknamed \"Pinocchio rexes.\"\n\nWhat Comes Next in the Research",

    "description": "ASU scientists found that people whose gut microbes make more methane extract more calories from fiber-rich foods. Methanogens help the microbiome turn fiber into energy by consuming hydrogen and producing methane. Using advanced metabolic chambers, researchers measured how diet and gut chemistry interact, showing that methane may signal efficient digestion. The work could lead to personalized diets based on individual microbiomes.",

    "content": "Deep within your gut lives a bustling world of microbes, each playing a role in digesting your food. Among them is one unusual microbe that produces methane -- a gas more often associated with cows and landfills than humans. According to new research from Arizona State University (ASU), this methane-making microorganism may influence how many calories your body extracts from what you eat.\n\nThe collection of microbes living in your digestive tract is known as the gut microbiome. While everyone has one, some people's microbiomes produce large amounts of methane, whereas others produce very little.\n\nMicrobes and the Energy Hidden in Fiber\n\nThe study found that people whose microbiomes generate more methane tend to extract more energy from high-fiber foods. This may help explain why the same meal can provide different calorie counts for different individuals once it reaches the colon.\n\nResearchers emphasized that high-fiber foods remain beneficial. People generally absorb more calories from a typical Western diet high in processed foods, regardless of methane levels. Even so, calorie absorption on a fiber-rich diet varies depending on how much methane a person's gut produces.\n\nThese findings suggest that gut methane could become a key factor in personalized nutrition -- a future where diets are tailored to the unique microbial activity in each person's digestive system\n\n\"That difference has important implications for diet interventions. It shows people on the same diet can respond differently. Part of that is due to the composition of their gut microbiome,\" says Blake Dirks, lead author of the study and graduate researcher at the Biodesign Center for Health Through Microbiomes. Dirks is also a PhD student in ASU's School of Life Sciences.\n\nPublished in The ISME Journal, the study identifies the key players: methane-producing microbes known as methanogens. These microorganisms appear to be linked with more efficient digestion and higher energy absorption.\n\nA major job of the microbiome is breaking down food that the body cannot digest on its own. Microbes ferment fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which provide a valuable energy source. During this process, hydrogen gas is released. Too much hydrogen can slow fermentation, but other microbes prevent this by consuming hydrogen -- keeping the digestive chemistry in balance.\n\nMethanogens are the hydrogen consumers. As they feed on hydrogen, they release methane as a byproduct. They are the only microbes in the human gut that produce this gas.\n\n\"The human body itself doesn't make methane, only the microbes do. So we suggested it can be a biomarker that signals efficient microbial production of short-chain fatty acids,\" says Rosy Krajmalnik-Brown, corresponding author of the study and director of the Biodesign Center for Health Through Microbiomes.\n\nHow Microbes May Shape Metabolism\n\nThe ASU researchers found that the interactions between these microbes may directly affect metabolism. Participants who produced more methane also had higher levels of short-chain fatty acids, indicating that more energy was being created and absorbed in the gut.\n\nTo test these effects, each participant followed two different diets. One included highly processed, low-fiber foods, while the other emphasized whole foods and fiber. Both diets contained equal proportions of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\n\nThe research was conducted in collaboration with the AdventHealth Translational Research Institute, which provided access to a specialized facility. Each participant spent six days in a sealed, hotel-like room called a whole-room calorimeter. This environment allowed researchers to precisely measure metabolism and methane output.",

    "content": "A detailed comparison of Incogni and DeleteMe, two of the most popular data removal services.\n\nWith a monthly or annual subscription, Incogni users can scan the web for their personal data and send automated removal requests to data brokers. After the initial scan, Incogni frequently rescans for the same personal data and sends fresh removal requests, particularly to new data brokers that seemingly don't cease to emerge.\n\nFounded in 2010, DeleteMe offers a similar data removal service. Users can submit their personal information and run a deep scan to find this information wherever it appears across the web. Then, DeleteMe will send removal requests to data brokers to scrub this information. It'll also run frequent re-scans and send new data removal requests to ensure your personal information stays off the web.\n\nWe've covered the surface of these two data removal services, but there's much more beneath. This guide compares Incogni and DeleteMe across key areas - broker coverage, pricing, features, ease of use, and customer support - to help you choose the best option for your needs.\n\nIncogni covers roughly 420 data brokers, while DeleteMe covers 750+ data brokers. However, these figures don't tell the complete story. These numbers represent the number of brokers where both platforms can send automated removal requests. However, users can send custom removal requests to other sites. A custom request involves Incogni or DeleteMe's team contacting the site on your behalf to request the deletion of your personal information.\n\nBased on the number of brokers to which you can send automated and manual removal requests, Incogni is a better option than DeleteMe.\n\nBoth Incogni and DeleteMe provide intuitive dashboards to track your data removal requests and their status. However, in my experience, DeleteMe offers more detailed, labeled reports, while Incogni offers generalized reports tailored to the risks associated with my data.\n\nOn Incogni, I received regular email updates on data removal requests, including when they were formally submitted and when the request was successful. I could also track the progress of my removal requests on the Incogni dashboard, including the estimated timeline for each pending request.\n\nOn DeleteMe, I also got frequent email updates about removal requests from start to finish. Likewise, I could always track the progress of each request from my DeleteMe dashboard.\n\nHowever, DeleteMe stood out with its PDF reports listing each site where my personal information was found, when removal requests were sent to each site, and the progress of each request. Its reports were more personalized than Incogni's.\n\nDeleteMe sends users their first detailed PDF report one week after signing up. Afterwards, detailed data removal reports are sent to users subscribed to the Standard plan every three months, or to users on the Premium plan every two months.\n\nDeleteMe offers the most comprehensive statistical reports, while Incogni offers simpler, generalized insights. Understandably, not everyone is interested in the minute details DeleteMe provides, but it's the best option if you want to understand every nook and cranny of your personal data removal.\n\nAlong with their core features, data removal services often provide some extra functionalities to help users boost their online privacy. From my experience testing Incogni and DeleteMe, the latter is the clear winner in this criterion.\n\nDeleteMe offers a complementary Cyber platform with valuable features. For one, you can search the dark web to see if your email address was compromised in any data leak. If you detect your email credentials on any website leak, it's a signal to change passwords for the affected website immediately.\n\nFor website owners, DeleteMe also offers a service to scan your domain name and detect whether sensitive data linked to it is present on the dark web. Several other complementary features exist, but these are the most notable I can point out.",

    "content": "Russians could soon lose their anonymity on the internet\n\nMandatory age verification is arriving everywhere, with Russian lawmakers becoming the latest to consider age-gating online content.\n\nOn October 21, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, Yevgeny Masharov, proposed a plan to force all internet users to prove their age. This would involve using their passport data, driver's license, or bank information to access online content intended for an 18+ audience.\n\nLike similar laws enforced across Western nations, the move stems from a bid to shield minors from harmful content. Yet, experts have long argued that age verification could negatively impact people's right to free speech, access to information, privacy, and digital security.\n\nFor Russian lawmakers, however, the risk is certainly worth the trouble - and adult-only content seems to be only the beginning.\n\nIn another announcement made to Gazeta.Ru, the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Information Technology, and Communications, Andrei Svintsov, also said that Russians are set to lose their anonymity on the internet within the next three years, five at most.\n\n\"That is, every internet user will register with some specialized identifier that will verify their age and other necessary access rights,\" said Svintsov. \"I think the time has come to introduce something similar to purge all social networks and platforms of these bots and the seemingly limitless amount of generated content.\"\n\nWhen mandatory age verification landed in the UK and the US, it was met with a fierce debate.\n\nOn one hand, both citizens and security experts were concerned that sharing their most sensitive personal information could compromise their privacy, making them vulnerable to data leaks and identity theft.\n\nDigital rights campaigners also warned that a vague definition of \"lawful but harmful content to minors\" will lead to greater online censorship, which could hinder people's right to free speech and access to information.\n\nIn a country like Russia, where internet censorship is among the strictest worldwide, such a risk is even stronger. That's especially true considering that, as Masharov explained to RIA Novosti, adult-only content will also include videos from bloggers featuring foul language, scenes of violence, and propaganda of antisocial behavior.\n\n\"The internet censorship in Russia started in 2012 with the first law on protecting children from harmful information. This essentially opened a Pandora's box, ultimately leading to an incredible expansion of the list of grounds for blocking internet sites and the establishment of total state online censorship,\" Darbinyan said.\n\nThe Kremlin began its quest to deanonymize the data of every user eight years after the adoption of Putin's Strategy for the Development of the Information Society until 2030, Darbinyan explains.\n\n\"And now, with the example of Western countries that have taken this dangerous and false path, Russian authorities are seeking to completely close the loop of laws that already impose numerous restrictions on private and anonymous communication online,\" Darbinyan added.\n\nIt is then only fair to believe that an age-gated and de-anonymized internet in Russia will come hand in hand with a fresh new crackdown on circumvention tools.",

    "pub_date": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 23:03:07 GMT",
    "content": "In the plastic recycling industry, the casualties keep coming.\n\nWaste management company Biffa's Sunderland plant closed in February after opening in 2022 at a cost of \u00a37m, while rival Viridor closed its Avonmouth plant in 2022, Skelmersdale in 2023 and confirmed this summer that its Rochester plant would close, too.\n\nLike falling dominoes, plastic recycling plant closures have been endemic across Europe too: another big name, Veolia, will close its two German operations this year, while seven plastic recyclers closed in the Netherlands last year.\n\nMeanwhile, companies Borealis, Dow and Neste have all dropped plans to construct new plastic recycling plants in Europe.\n\nIndustry body Plastic Recyclers Europe equates this to the loss of nearly one million tonnes of plastic recycling capacity since 2023.\n\nAnd more closures are likely, warns James McLeary, managing director for Biffa's polymers division, as the industry here and in Europe faces its most challenging year yet. High energy and labour costs here are two factors, in parallel with the fact that sourcing virgin and recycled plastic from Asia is currently cheaper than buying European recycled plastic.\n\nPlastic recycling plant closures are affecting the US as well, also prompted by the low price of virgin plastic, causing the country to miss its recycled content targets, as S&P Global reports.\n\n\"There's a big global dependence building on Asian plants, and we then have the situation where (plant operators in the UK and Europe) are going to make very tough decisions.\n\nLoopholes in current UK legislation mean plastic waste collectors are inadvertently incentivised to export rather than process domestically. Meanwhile, manufacturers using plastic packaging are still inclined to use cheaper virgin plastic from abroad, and stomach being taxed for it.\n\nAhmed Detta, CEO and founder of plastic waste recycler Enviroo, is frustrated by the flaws and contradictions that he feels are plaguing the industry and disrupting the goal of creating a circular economy that keeps materials in use for as long as possible.\n\n\"For me, a circular economy is a win-win. Every single person in that journey has to have some benefit, and that's not working,\" says Mr Detta, who is based in London.\n\n\"Brands aren't aligning with the circular economy. They're saying, 'why should I buy recycled material when it's cheaper for me to pay the fine for the plastics packaging tax, than actually pay for recycled materials? No one is saying, 'let's unite'.\"\n\nSo concerned is RECOUP, a UK-based plastic recycling independent authority, that its head of policy and infrastructure, Steve Morgan, warns: \"We are almost witnessing the demise of plastic recycling as we know it, unless we have some interventions. There's no way a lot of recyclers in the UK can compete.\"\n\nUK regulations have benefited foreign markets more than they have the UK, and serious reform is needed, Mr Morgan argues.\n\n\"There are an awful lot of fantastic technologies developing. But it's a scale up of those and how they can actually make money, to continue to exist and then also thrive, is the secondary thing,\" says Mr Morgan, who is based in Peterborough.",

Think Darth Vader after a growth spurt.\n\nSir Stephen Fry lived up to his brainy reputation over breakfast, by predicting the chessboard was back: \"I could be a knight - oh, I already am,\" he joked. Comic Alan Carr was predictably quick to prick any potential pomposity: \"Or an old queen,\" he quipped.\n\nIn fact, Alan continues to relish his role as a traitor with increasing enthusiasm.\n\nWhen in the turret discussing who to murder next, he asked fellow traitors singer Cat Burns and presenter Jonathan Ross: \"Stephen Fry: Shall we just get on with it and kill him? What's a knighthood when you're dead?\"\n\n\"Brutal,\" Jonathan replied, and he wasn't wrong.",

    "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country is prepared to resume trade talks with the US \"when the Americans are ready.\"\n\nHis remarks come after US President Donald Trump announced an immediate end to all trade negotiations with Canada over an advert critical of the tariffs he has imposed on the nation.\n\nTrump wrote on social media that the advert was \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\", adding that trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".\n\nTrump has allowed exemptions for goods that fall under a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, negotiated during his first term.\n\nBut since his election earlier this year, Canada's Carney has attempted to strike a deal that would ease the tariffs. Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, making its economy particularly vulnerable.\n\nThis effort has been complicated by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is one of the most vocal critics of the taxes levied on US firms buying Canadian products.\n\nIn the minute-long advert published last week, Reagan's voice can be heard narrating over images that include the New York Stock Exchange and cranes adorned with both US and Canadian flags.\n\nThe video excerpts from a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focuses on foreign trade.\n\n\"When someone says, 'let's impose tariffs on foreign imports', it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works - but only for a short time,\" Reagan says in the advert.\n\n\"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\n\n\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Foundation - which is charged with preserving his legacy - released a statement on Thursday saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.\n\nIt said the advert \"misrepresents\" the former president's address, without specifying why, and accused the Ontario government of not seeking permission to use and edit the remarks.\n\nThe foundation said it was \"reviewing its legal options\".\n\nTrump referenced this statement, and said the video was designed to \"interfere with\" the US Supreme Court's upcoming decision in November on whether Washington's sweeping tariffs on many nations' products are legal.",

Mr Chansiri is no longer willing to provide that financial support.\n\n\"While the recent fan boycott has not directly caused the insolvency, it has increased financial pressure on the club. As a result, the owner has chosen to place the club into administration.\n\n\"Supporters are the backbone of any football club. The money they spend at the gate and in the ground is vital.

    "pub_date": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 15:34:35 -0400",
    "content": "Konstantin Toropin, Associated Press Konstantin Toropin, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, the Pentagon announced Friday, in the latest escalation of military firepower in a region where the Trump administration has unleashed more rapid strikes in recent days against boats it accuses of carrying drugs.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to deploy to the U.S. Southern Command region to \"bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said on social media.\n\nThe USS Ford, which has five destroyers in its strike group, is now deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. One of its destroyers is in the Arabian Sea and another is in the Red Sea, a person familiar with the operation told The Associated Press. As of Friday, the aircraft carrier was in port in Croatia on the Adriatic Sea.\n\nThe person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, would not say how long it would take for the strike group to arrive in the waters off South America or if all five destroyers would make the journey.\n\nDeploying an aircraft carrier will surge major additional resources to a region that has already seen an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Venezuela. The latest deployment and the quickening pace of the U.S. strikes, including one Friday, raised new speculation about how far the Trump administration may go in operations it says are targeted at drug trafficking, including whether it could try to topple Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.\n\nThere are already more than 6,000 sailors and Marines on eight warships in the region. If the entire USS Ford strike group arrives, that could bring nearly 4,500 more sailors as well as the nine squadrons of aircraft assigned to the carrier.\n\nComplicating the situation is Tropical Storm Melissa, which has been nearly stationary in the central Caribbean with forecasters warning it could soon strengthen into a powerful hurricane.\n\nHours before Parnell announced the news, Hegseth said the military had conducted the 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, leaving six people dead and bringing the death count for the attacks that began in early September to at least 43 people.\n\nHegseth said on social media that the vessel struck overnight was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. It was the second time the Trump administration has tied one of its operations to the gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison.\n\nThe strikes have ramped up from one every few weeks when they first began last month to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people. Two of the most recent strikes were carried out in the eastern Pacific Ocean, expanding the area where the military has launched attacks and shifting to where much of the cocaine from the world's largest producers is smuggled.\n\n\"If you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat Al-Qaeda,\" Hegseth said in his post. \"Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you.\"\n\nThe strike drew parallels to the first announced by the U.S. last month by focusing on Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization and blamed for being at the root of the violence and drug dealing that plague some cities.\n\nWhile not mentioning the origin of the latest boat, the Republican administration says at least four of the boats it has hit have come from Venezuela. On Thursday, the U.S. military flew a pair of supersonic heavy bombers up to the coast of Venezuela.\n\nMaduro on Thursday praised security forces and a civilian militia for defense exercises along some 2,000 kilometers (about 1,200 miles) of coastline to prepare for the possibility of a U.S. attack.",

    "content": "Hyung-Jin Kim, Associated Press Hyung-Jin Kim, Associated Press\n\nKim Tong-Hyung, Associated Press Kim Tong-Hyung, Associated Press\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) - The last time U.S. President Donald Trump visited South Korea in 2019, he made a surprise trip to the border with North Korea for an impromptu meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to revive faltering nuclear talks.\n\nNow, as Trump is set to make his first trip to Asia since his return to office, speculation is rife that he may seek to meet Kim again during his stop in South Korea. If realized, it would mark the two's first summit since their last meeting at the Korean border village of Panmunjom in June 2019, and fourth overall.\n\nMany experts say prospects for another impromptu meeting aren't bright this time but predict Trump and Kim could eventually sit down for talks again in coming months. Others dispute that, saying a quick resumption of diplomacy isn't still likely given how much has changed since 2019 - both the size of North Korea's nuclear program and its foreign policy leverage.\n\nTrump has repeatedly expressed his desire to restore diplomacy with Kim as he boasted of his relationship with the North Korean leader and called him \"a smart guy.\" Ending his silence on Trump's outreach, Kim last month said he held \"good personal memories\" of Trump and suggested he could return to talks if the U.S. drops \"its delusional obsession with denuclearization\" of North Korea.\n\nBoth Washington and Pyongyang haven't hinted at any high-profile meeting ahead of the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea. But South Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-young told lawmakers in mid-October that it was possible for Trump and Kim to meet at Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone again when the U.S. president comes to South Korea after visiting Malaysia and Japan.\n\n\"We should see prospects for their meeting have increased,\" said Ban Kil Joo, assistant professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul. He cited the recent suspension of civilian tours to the southern side of Panmunjom and Kim's comments about a possible return to talks.\n\nIf the meeting doesn't occur, Ban said Kim will likely determine whether to resume diplomacy with Trump when he holds a major ruling party conference expected in January.\n\nNo notable logistical preparations that imply an impending Kim-Trump meeting have been reported, but observers note that the 2019 get-together was arranged only a day after Trump issued an unorthodox meeting invitation by tweet.\n\nSince his earlier diplomacy with Trump fell apart due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea, Kim has accelerated the expansion of an arsenal of nuclear-capable missiles designed to strike the U.S. and its allies. He has also strengthened his diplomatic footprint by aligning with Russia over its war in Ukraine and tightening relations with China.\n\nSubsequently, Kim's sense of urgency for talks with the United States could be much weaker now than it was six years ago, though some experts argue Kim would need to brace for the end of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\"Considering the current situation, it seems difficult to imagine Kim Jong Un coming over for talks,\" said Kim Tae-hyung, a professor at Seoul's Soongsil University.\n\nWith an enlarged nuclear arsenal, stronger diplomatic backing from Russia and China and the weakening enforcement of sanctions, Kim has greater leverage and clearly wants the U.S. to acknowledge North Korea as a nuclear power, a status needed to call for the lifting of U.N. sanctions. But that would run counter to the U.S. and its allies' long-held position that sanctions would stay in place unless North Korea fully abandons its nuclear program.\n\n\"If a meeting with Kim Jong Un happens, Trump would brag of it and boast he's the one who can resolve Korean Peninsula issues as well, so he has something to gain ... But would the U.S. have something substantial to give Kim Jong Un in return?\" said Chung Jin-young, a former dean of the Graduate School of Pan-Pacific International Studies at South Korea's Kyung Hee University.",

    "description": "A massive genetic study found that naturally lower cholesterol is linked to a dramatically reduced risk of dementia. The research simulated the effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs and showed up to an 80% lower risk for certain genetic profiles. Scientists believe high cholesterol may contribute to dementia through atherosclerosis and small blood clots. Long-term trials could confirm whether medications can replicate this protective effect.",
    "pub_date": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:24:49 EDT",
    "content": "Having lower cholesterol levels may help protect against dementia, according to a large-scale international study led by the University of Bristol. The research, involving data from more than one million participants, found that people with genetic traits that naturally reduce cholesterol are less likely to develop dementia.\n\nThe work was led by Dr. Liv Tybj\u00e6rg Nordestgaard during her time at the University of Bristol and at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Copenhagen University Hospital -- Herlev and Gentofte. The findings were published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nGenetic Clues and Cholesterol-Lowering Effects\n\nSome individuals are born with genetic variants that affect the same proteins targeted by cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins and ezetimibe. To explore whether these drugs might influence dementia risk, the team used a technique called Mendelian Randomization. This method allows scientists to study how specific genetic variants mimic the effects of a treatment while minimizing the influence of outside factors like weight, diet, or lifestyle.\n\nBy comparing people with and without these cholesterol-lowering genetic variants, the researchers observed a clear difference in dementia risk. A small decrease in cholesterol levels (about one millimole per liter) was associated with up to an 80% reduction in dementia risk for certain drug-related genetic targets.\n\nLower Cholesterol, Lower Dementia Risk\n\n\"What our study indicates is that if you have these variants that lower your cholesterol, it looks like you have a significantly lower risk of developing dementia,\" said Dr. Nordestgaard, who now works in the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Copenhagen University Hospital -- Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg hospital.\n\nThe results suggest that keeping cholesterol levels low -- whether through genetics or medical treatment -- may protect against dementia. However, the research does not yet confirm that cholesterol-lowering drugs themselves directly prevent the disease.\n\nWhy Studying Dementia Is So Challenging\n\nBecause dementia often develops late in life, studying its causes requires tracking participants for decades. This makes it difficult to establish cause and effect in traditional clinical trials.\n\nIt also remains unclear why high cholesterol raises dementia risk. One explanation, according to Dr. Nordestgaard, is that high cholesterol contributes to atherosclerosis -- the buildup of fatty deposits in blood vessels.\n\nHow Cholesterol May Harm the Brain\n\n\"Atherosclerosis is a result of the accumulation of cholesterol in your blood vessels,\" Dr. Nordestgaard said. \"It can be in both the body and the brain and increases the risk of forming small blood clots -- one of the causes of dementia.\n\n\"It would be a really good next step to carry out randomised clinical trials over 10 or 30 years, for example, where you give the participants cholesterol-lowering medication and then look at the risk of developing dementia,\" Dr. Nordestgaard added.\n\nGlobal Collaboration and Funding",

With the ultra-sensitive ASA-PD imaging method, they captured these clusters in brain tissue, finding larger and more numerous versions in patients with Parkinson\u2019s. The discovery could mark a turning point in diagnosing and treating the disease, revealing the first visible signs long before symptoms appear.",

    "content": "For the first time, researchers have directly seen and measured the protein clusters thought to spark Parkinson's disease, marking a major milestone in understanding the world's fastest-growing neurological condition.\n\nThese microscopic clusters, known as alpha-synuclein oligomers, have long been suspected as the starting point for Parkinson's, but they have remained undetectable in human brain tissue -- until now.\n\nA team from the University of Cambridge, UCL, the Francis Crick Institute, and Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al developed a powerful imaging approach that allows scientists to visualize, count, and compare these protein clumps in human brain tissue. One researcher described the breakthrough as \"like being able to see stars in broad daylight.\"\n\nPublished in Nature Biomedical Engineering, the findings could transform how scientists study Parkinson's, offering new insights into how it spreads through the brain and paving the way for earlier diagnosis and more targeted treatments.\n\nParkinson's: A Growing Global Health Challenge\n\nMore than 166,000 people in the UK currently live with Parkinson's disease, and the global total is expected to reach 25 million by 2050. While existing drugs can ease symptoms such as tremors and stiffness, none can halt or slow the disease's progression.\n\nFor over a century, doctors have identified Parkinson's by the presence of large protein deposits known as Lewy bodies. Yet researchers have long believed that smaller, early-stage oligomers may actually cause the damage to brain cells. Until now, these microscopic structures, just a few nanometers long, were impossible to observe directly.\n\nSeeing Parkinson's at Its Earliest Stages\n\n\"Lewy bodies are the hallmark of Parkinson's, but they essentially tell you where the disease has been, not where it is right now,\" said Professor Steven Lee from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who co-led the research. \"If we can observe Parkinson's at its earliest stages, that would tell us a whole lot more about how the disease develops in the brain and how we might be able to treat it.\"\n\nTo achieve this, the researchers created a method called ASA-PD (Advanced Sensing of Aggregates for Parkinson's Disease). This ultra-sensitive fluorescence microscopy technique can detect and analyze millions of oligomers in post-mortem brain samples. Because the oligomers are so tiny, their signal is faint, but ASA-PD enhances that signal while reducing background noise, allowing scientists to clearly see individual alpha-synuclein clusters for the first time.\n\n\"This is the first time we've been able to look at oligomers directly in human brain tissue at this scale: it's like being able to see stars in broad daylight,\" said co-first author Dr Rebecca Andrews, who conducted the work when she was a postdoctoral researcher in Lee's lab. \"It opens new doors in Parkinson's research.\"\n\nThe researchers examined brain tissue from people with Parkinson's and compared it to samples from healthy individuals of similar age. They found that oligomers were present in both groups, but in those with Parkinson's, the clusters were larger, brighter, and far more numerous. This difference suggests a strong connection between oligomer growth and disease progression.\n\nClues to the Earliest Signs of Disease\n\nThe team also identified a unique subset of oligomers found only in Parkinson's patients, which may represent the earliest detectable signs of the disease -- possibly appearing years before symptoms emerge.\n\n\"This method doesn't just give us a snapshot,\" said Professor Lucien Weiss from Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, wo co-led the research. \"It offers a whole atlas of protein changes across the brain and similar technologies could be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's.",

    "content": "Amazon has just released details on its upcoming Black Friday sale, and while the dates haven't been announced yet, the retailer has early deals you can shop right now.\n\n\u2022 Shop more early Amazon holiday deals\n\nWhile there are discounts on kitchen appliances, vacuums, holiday decor, and toys, the best early Black Friday deals that are worth buying are on Amazon's best-selling devices. You can find several record-low prices, with up to 60% off Fire TVs, Ring Doorbells, Blink security cameras, Fire TV Sticks, and more.\n\nI've rounded up today's 15 best early Black Friday device deals below, with prices starting at $17.99. While all of the offers listed below offer incredible value, a few stand-out deals include the latest Blink Video Doorbell on sale for only $29.99 (originally $69.99), a massive 50% discount on the latest Ring Video Doorbell, bringing the price down to $49.99 (originally $99.99), and the Blink Mini 2 security camera on sale for just $17.99 (originally $39.99).\n\nKeep in mind that many of today's early Black Friday device deals are at record-low or near-record-low prices, and I can't imagine you'll find significantly cheaper prices on Black Friday itself. If you see a gadget below that you like, I recommend taking advantage now and getting a head start on your holiday shopping.\n\nI've had my eye on the Blink Mini 2 since its release, and now that it's on sale for a record-low price of $17.99 - it's a must-buy. The compact security camera features two-way audio and will alert your phone when motion is detected. The Blink 2 also includes a 1080p HD live view, night view in color with a built-in spotlight, and a wider field of view.\n\nThe new version of Amazon's standard Fire TV Stick is on sale for just $19.99 ahead of Black Friday. In our Fire TV Stick review, we found the original version was a cheap way to add essential smart features to your TV, including access to streaming apps in HD, Alexa voice controls, and the ability to control other smart home devices.\n\nAs the name suggests, the Fire TV Stick 4K streams shows and movies on your TV in ultra-high definition 4K resolution. It's a good offer for a solid streaming stick that comes with access to all the major apps and supports voice controls through Alexa. Amazon's pre-Black Friday deal shaves 40% off the retail price.\n\nToday's price on Amazon's premium streaming device is just $7 shy of the record low. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max streams the same content in the same quality as the standard 4K version, but the extra power inside means faster performance when navigating apps. Plus, it uses WiFi 6E technology to give you a more stable and consistent streaming experience.\n\nOne of my favorite early Black Friday deals at Amazon is the all-new Blink Video Doorbell at its lowest price ever. The Blink doorbell alerts you when motion is detected and features infrared night vision, two-way audio, a two-year battery life, and an expanded field of view.\n\nAmazon's Echo devices are always best-sellers during the holidays, and the retailer currently has the Echo Show 8 smart display on sale for $99.99. Thanks to Alexa compatibility, the eight-inch display allows you to make calls, watch movies, check the weather, and control compatible smart home devices completely hands-free.\n\nThe 4th-generation Blink outdoor security camera features enhanced motion detection, two-way audio, a two-year battery life, and works with Amazon Alexa for hands-free control. Today's pre-Black Friday deal is a massive 60% discount and a return to the record-low price.\n\nI already own the best-selling Ring Video Doorbell and can't imagine living without it. The smart doorbell includes a built-in battery and allows you to see, hear, and speak to anyone from your phone or computer. Today's deal from Amazon is a new record-low price, and I can't imagine it will drop further on Black Friday.\n\nSave a whopping $100 on this premium wired video doorbell with head-to-toe HD+ video. As well as high-resolution footage, we love the 3D motion detection feature and its Alexa integration. All of this for a record-low price of a shade under $130 is an absolute steal ahead of Black Friday.\n\nThe Ring Floodlight Camera Wired Plus is on sale for a record-low price at Amazon's early sale. The motion-activated HD camera features two-way talk, customizable motion zones, and notifies your smartphone, tablet, or laptop when motion is detected.",

    "content": "This week we've gone hands-on with both the Samsung Galaxy XR and new Apple Vision Pro headsets, and while the M5-powered Vision Pro has impressed us - we gave it a four-and-a-half star review - we imagine the lower price yet still premium experience of Samsung's XR hardware will help to win over those still enthused about a prosumer headset.\n\nThanks to their impressive displays offering superb visual clarity, chipsets with plenty of pepper for a wide range of use cases and comfy designs - facilitated by the Galaxy XR's lower weight and Vision Pro's new headband - there's a lot to love about either option.\n\nDespite the positives, I have a bone to pick with both devices - why hasn't either headset found a clean and affordable solution for glasses wearers?\n\nA quick Google search for glasses-wearing stats (at least for the US) suggests well over half of adults wear (or at least should wear) prescription lenses. These same adults will be the target audience for Apple and Samsung's headsets - not simply because of the price, but because weighty VR devices aren't the most comfortable for kids owing to their smaller heads and necks.\n\nThis is not an insignificant sum, especially considering both devices already cost so much before you purchase add-ons, and doubly so when rivals like Meta already have a free solution.\n\nThat is, with Meta Quest 3 headsets, the facial interface is adjustable (or you can opt for a spacer in the case of the 3S), which leaves enough room for your glasses. The Meta Quest Pro (which matches up more closely capability-wise wise with the Samsung and Apple options) also left room for specs between your face and the display, and worked just fine with eye-tracking once calibrated.\n\nQuest Pro lenses were also available, and many felt they were a more elegant solution, but crucially, they were not essential for glasses wearers.\n\nI'd also be less critical of lens inserts if they were at least universal.\n\nIf you could take your lenses between devices - whether that's as you upgrade to a different brand, or, for example, you have your own personal Vision pro while your workplace relies on Samsung Galaxy XR headsets - paying close to $100 for standardized lenses would make more sense than model-specific alternatives.\n\nThat would be absurd, and it should be just as absurd in the XR space.\n\nAs headsets and glasses become the norm I do think we need to find a solution - and universal lenses do feel like the best option - because right now it's a constant friction point I hear from many glasses wearers, and there's an awful lot of us.",
