  "content": "A detailed comparison of Incogni and DeleteMe, two of the most popular data removal services.\n\nWith a monthly or annual subscription, Incogni users can scan the web for their personal data and send automated removal requests to data brokers. After the initial scan, Incogni frequently rescans for the same personal data and sends fresh removal requests, particularly to new data brokers that seemingly don't cease to emerge.\n\nFounded in 2010, DeleteMe offers a similar data removal service. Users can submit their personal information and run a deep scan to find this information wherever it appears across the web. Then, DeleteMe will send removal requests to data brokers to scrub this information. It'll also run frequent re-scans and send new data removal requests to ensure your personal information stays off the web.\n\nWe've covered the surface of these two data removal services, but there's much more beneath. This guide compares Incogni and DeleteMe across key areas - broker coverage, pricing, features, ease of use, and customer support - to help you choose the best option for your needs.\n\nIncogni covers roughly 420 data brokers, while DeleteMe covers 750+ data brokers. However, these figures don't tell the complete story. These numbers represent the number of brokers where both platforms can send automated removal requests. However, users can send custom removal requests to other sites. A custom request involves Incogni or DeleteMe's team contacting the site on your behalf to request the deletion of your personal information.\n\nBased on the number of brokers to which you can send automated and manual removal requests, Incogni is a better option than DeleteMe.\n\nBoth Incogni and DeleteMe provide intuitive dashboards to track your data removal requests and their status. However, in my experience, DeleteMe offers more detailed, labeled reports, while Incogni offers generalized reports tailored to the risks associated with my data.\n\nOn Incogni, I received regular email updates on data removal requests, including when they were formally submitted and when the request was successful. I could also track the progress of my removal requests on the Incogni dashboard, including the estimated timeline for each pending request.\n\nOn DeleteMe, I also got frequent email updates about removal requests from start to finish. Likewise, I could always track the progress of each request from my DeleteMe dashboard.\n\nHowever, DeleteMe stood out with its PDF reports listing each site where my personal information was found, when removal requests were sent to each site, and the progress of each request. Its reports were more personalized than Incogni's.\n\nDeleteMe sends users their first detailed PDF report one week after signing up. Afterwards, detailed data removal reports are sent to users subscribed to the Standard plan every three months, or to users on the Premium plan every two months.\n\nDeleteMe offers the most comprehensive statistical reports, while Incogni offers simpler, generalized insights. Understandably, not everyone is interested in the minute details DeleteMe provides, but it's the best option if you want to understand every nook and cranny of your personal data removal.\n\nAlong with their core features, data removal services often provide some extra functionalities to help users boost their online privacy. From my experience testing Incogni and DeleteMe, the latter is the clear winner in this criterion.\n\nDeleteMe offers a complementary Cyber platform with valuable features. For one, you can search the dark web to see if your email address was compromised in any data leak. If you detect your email credentials on any website leak, it's a signal to change passwords for the affected website immediately.\n\nFor website owners, DeleteMe also offers a service to scan your domain name and detect whether sensitive data linked to it is present on the dark web. Several other complementary features exist, but these are the most notable I can point out.",
