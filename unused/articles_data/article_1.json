  "content": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has refused to rule out an income tax rise in next month's Budget, amid speculation she is considering breaking a key Labour election pledge.\n\nAsked about reports, first published in The Guardian newspaper, that the Treasury is in active discussions over raising the rate, Reeves said she would \"continue to support working people by keeping their taxes as low as possible\".\n\nReeves' refusal to rule out a rise does not mean one is inevitable as Chancellors rarely confirm or deny specific tax measures ahead of a Budget.\n\nBut her careful language contrasts with comments in September that \"manifesto commitments stand\" on not raising income tax, National Insurance or VAT.\n\nLabour's 2024 general election manifesto contained a pledge not to raise \"the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax\".\n\nThe party also promised not to increase National Insurance - prompting a row last autumn when it announced a hike in the contributions paid by employers.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Leeds on Friday, Reeves said: \"Although I can't talk about individual measures at this stage, I understand that the cost of living is still people's number one concern.\"\n\nShe went on to say that her aim was to \"ensure that we continue to support working people by keeping their taxes as low as possible\" but that she was still \"going through the process\" of writing her Budget.\n\nShe also said that although the inflation figures this week \"came in better than expected\" there was \"obviously much more to do.\"\n\nThe chancellor has signalled she is likely to focus on wealthy individuals at the Budget, saying \"those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share\".\n\nHowever, economists say such steps will not raise enough to close the hole in the government's finances, leaving Reeves under pressure to consider more politically sensitive options.\n\nInfluential think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says Reeves will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes to make up a \u00a322bn shortfall in the government's finances.\n\nThe effective interest rates on UK government debt has fallen sharply, but Reeves has been left with very little room to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules without increasing taxes.\n\nThese rules mean her plans must be projected to get government debt falling as a share of national income by 2029-30, and day-to-day government costs must be paid for by tax income rather than borrowing.\n\nCurrently, Income tax is charged on earnings above the personal allowance of \u00a312,570, which is tax-free.",
