  "content": "Planned airport expansion that would result in hundreds of thousands of extra flights a year could risk the government's own net zero goals, a committee of MPs has found.\n\nThe report from the cross-party Environmental Audit Committee said the government had also \"not demonstrated\" that the negative climate impact of expansion would be outweighed by the economic growth created.\n\nThe government has approved several airport expansion schemes, most recently a third runway at London Heathrow and a second runway at Gatwick.\n\nThe Department for Transport said airport expansion plans would \"only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change\".\n\nMinisters are expected to announce which of two rival proposals is preferred for the expansion of Heathrow within weeks.\n\nThe Environmental Audit Committee said the only prospect of meeting net zero would be if airport expansion was \"accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation\".\n\nHowever, its chair Toby Perkin noted that technological solutions - such as sustainable aviation fuel - were not yet being used on a commercial scale.\n\nThe report said the plans were likely to provide some economic growth, but how much was unclear, and the government had not provided supporting evidence.\n\nThe UK has legally binding targets to reduce its levels of planet-warming emissions, and contribute to the global goal of preventing average temperatures rising by more than 1.5C by 2050.\n\nAbove this temperature level, scientists anticipate significant impacts from global sea level rise, more extreme weather and impacts on agriculture.\n\nTo prevent temperatures increasing there is a limit to the amount of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, that the world can release, and the UK has set out its own share of these - known as carbon budgets.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told Parliament that Heathrow's expansion plans \"must align with our legal, environmental and climate commitments\".\n\nA spokesperson for the DfT said: \"We have been clear that airport expansion will only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change, including net zero, and we will be seeking advice from the independent Climate Change Committee to inform the ANPS review.\"\n\nBut Dr Alex Chapman, a senior researcher at New Economics Foundation (a think tank focused on environmental and social policies) who gave evidence to the environmental audit committee, said the inquiry was a \"damning assessment of this government's airport expansion agenda\".\n\n\"This government is unable to produce evidence that supports their central claim: that growing our airports will grow our economy.",
