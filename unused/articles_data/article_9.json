Canadian officials remain ready to continue talks to reduce tariffs in certain sectors, he said.\n\n\"We can't control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,\" Carney said Friday morning before boarding a flight to Asia. \"We have to focus on what we can control and realize what we can't control.\"\n\nCarney is trying to secure a trade deal with Trump, but tariffs are taking a toll in the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors.\n\nCarney spoke to Ford Thursday night and again Friday.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said talks with Canada have not led to any constructive progress.",
