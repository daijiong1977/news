  "summary_en": "During the World Cup swimming competition in Westmont, Australian swimmer Lani Pallister achieved a remarkable performance in the women's 1500-meter freestyle event, setting a new Australian national record with a time of 15:13.83. This achievement places her as the second-fastest performer in history for this distance, trailing only American swimming legend Katie Ledecky, who holds the world record at 15:08.24. Pallister's performance represented a significant improvement of nearly eight seconds from her previous Australian record of 15:21.43, which she had established at the 2022 World Short Course Championships in Melbourne. The competition featured several other notable performances, including American Regan Smith equaling her world record in the 100-meter backstroke and setting an American record in the 200-meter butterfly, while Australian teammate Mollie O'Callaghan broke the world record in the 200-meter freestyle. In the 1500-meter freestyle final, Pallister finished well ahead of second-place finisher Erika Fairweather of New Zealand, who clocked 15:30.22. The event was part of the third day of finals at the World Cup stop in Westmont, with one remaining session scheduled. Other notable swimmers competing included Americans Shaine Casas, who won the 400-meter individual medley, and Carson Foster, who placed second in that event. The competition demonstrated the high level of international swimming talent currently competing on the World Cup circuit, with multiple national and world records being challenged throughout the event.",

  "original_content": "World Cup Westmont - Day Three Finals: Lani Pallister Pops Aussie Record in 1500 Freestyle; Becomes No. 2 Performer in History\n\nJust one session remains of the World Cup stop in Westmont, and if the opening days of action are any indication, the evening should provide some dazzling performances. Already, Regan Smith has equaled her world record in the 100-meter backstroke and set an American record in the 200 butterfly. Meanwhile, Australia's Mollie O'Callaghan destroyed the world record in the 200 freestyle.\n\nOn Sunday night, Smith will return to the pool for a duel with Aussie Kaylee McKeown in the 200 backstroke while O'Callaghan will chase a title in the 100 freestyle. Gretchen Walsh (100 butterfly) and Luke Hobson (200 freestyle) will contest events in which they own the world record and Canadian Ilya Kharun will chase his latest World Cup victory, this time as the top seed in the 200 butterfly.\n\nHere is an event-by-event recap of the Day Three finals:\n\nOne week after racing the 400 IM in an unseeded heat, American Shaine Casas contested the timed final of the event at night and walked away with a victory. As expected, Casas built a lead during the opening butterfly and backstroke legs and held off countryman Carson Foster. Casas registered a time of 3:57.41, with Foster taking second place in 3:58.18. They were the only athletes to break the four-minute barrier.\n\nCasas opened up a 1.37-second advantage on Foster during the first half of the race and slightly added to the edge on breaststroke to lead by 1.79 seconds entering the freestyle leg. While Foster cut into his deficit over the last 100 meters, it was not enough to reel in Casas, who finished just shy of the World Cup record.\n\nComing off a win last weekend in the 800 freestyle, Australian Lani Pallister extended her distance success to the 1500 freestyle in Westmont - and in style. Pallister put together a time of 15:13.83, which broke her national record by nearly eight seconds and made the Aussie the No. 2 performer in history. Only American Katie Ledecky (15:08.24) has been faster than Pallister.\n\nPallister's previous Australian record of 15:21.43 was set at the 2022 World Short Course Championships in Melbourne. She was followed in second place on Sunday night by New Zealand's Erika Fairweather, who clocked in at 15:30.22.",

This collaborative effort aims to challenge InfiniBand's current dominance in high-performance AI networking, where InfiniBand currently accounts for approximately 80% of GPU and accelerator interconnect infrastructure. The ESUN initiative represents a significant industry movement toward open standards that could potentially reduce costs and increase interoperability in AI cluster networking. Supporters argue that Ethernet's maturity, widespread engineering familiarity, and cost-effectiveness make it an attractive alternative to proprietary systems like InfiniBand. The initiative builds upon OCP's previous SUE-Transport program and will focus on defining standards for switch behavior, protocol headers, error handling, and lossless data transfer.

The group plans to coordinate with the Ultra Ethernet Consortium and IEEE 802.3 standards body to ensure ecosystem alignment. Several companies have already developed Ethernet-based products targeting AI scale-up, including Broadcom's Tomahawk Ultra switch and Nvidia's Spectrum-X platform. However, the success of ESUN depends on Ethernet's ability to match InfiniBand's performance in demanding AI workloads where latency and reliability are critical. While the initiative represents an ambitious push for open hardware standards, industry observers note that replacing established InfiniBand networks will require demonstrated performance under real-world AI workloads.

  "original_content": "The Open Compute Project (OCP) has announced a new initiative known as Ethernet for Scale-Up Networking (ESUN), aimed at developing open standards for high-performance connections within artificial intelligence clusters. This collaboration brings together companies such as Meta, Nvidia, AMD, Cisco, and OpenAI to explore how Ethernet can rival existing interconnects like InfiniBand in large-scale data centers. Other companies joining the collaboration include Arista, ARM, Broadcom, HPE Networking, Marvell, Microsoft, and Oracle. InfiniBand has long dominated the market for high-speed AI networking, accounting for roughly 80% of the infrastructure connecting GPUs and accelerators. However, the ESUN group believes that Ethernet's maturity, cost-effectiveness, and interoperability make it a strong candidate for scaling up AI clusters. Unlike proprietary systems, Ethernet's widespread familiarity among engineers could help reduce complexity in managing massive AI workloads. Supporters argue that using Ethernet as an open standard will allow operators to scale infrastructure while lowering costs. OCP's new AI tools initiative builds on earlier work under its SUE-Transport (SUE-T) program, which explored Ethernet transport for multi-processor systems. ESUN's participants will meet regularly to define standards for switch behavior, including protocol headers, error handling, and lossless data transfer. The group will also study how network design affects load balancing and memory ordering within GPU-based systems. It plans to coordinate with the Ultra Ethernet Consortium and the IEEE 802.3 standards body to ensure alignment across the wider Ethernet ecosystem. Several firms have already developed Ethernet-based products targeting AI scale-up - Broadcom's Tomahawk Ultra switch, for example, supports up to 77 billion packets per second, and Nvidia's Spectrum-X platform also combines Ethernet with acceleration hardware for AI clusters. However, Meta, which co-founded OCP in 2011, views ESUN as a natural extension of its push for open hardware within data centers. Even so, observers note that replacing established InfiniBand networks would require Ethernet to prove itself under the most demanding AI workloads, where latency and reliability are critical. ESUN's success will depend on balancing openness with performance. Advocates see a future where AI systems run on interoperable hardware using standardized Ethernet technologies. Yet, given the scale and sensitivity of AI infrastructure, it remains uncertain whether industry momentum will shift decisively away from proprietary interconnects. For now, ESUN represents an ambitious effort, and whether it can match InfiniBand's performance remains to be seen.",
