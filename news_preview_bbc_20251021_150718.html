<div class='article'><h2>Plans for Trump-Putin meeting shelved days after Budapest talks proposed</h2>

<p>Last Thursday Trump said he and the Russian president would hold talks in Budapest within two weeks to discuss the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov was due to be held this week - but the White House said the two had had a &quot;productive&quot; call and that a meeting was no longer &quot;necessary&quot;.</p>
<p>The White House did not share any more details on why the talks had been put on hold.</p>
<p>But key differences between US proposals and Russia&#x27;s preconditions for peace became increasingly clear this week, and appear to have dashed chances of a summit between the two presidents.</p>
<p>Trump had discussed a Budapest summit over the phone with Putin, a day before meeting Ukraine&#x27;s Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House.</p>
<p>Some reports suggested his talks with Zelensky had been a &quot;shouting match&quot;, with sources suggesting Trump had pushed him to give up large areas of territory in eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known as the Donbas, as part of a deal with Russia.</p>
<p>However, Zelensky has always said Ukraine cannot relinquish the parts of the Donbas it still holds, on the grounds that Russia could later use the area as a springboard for further attacks.</p>
<p>On Monday, Trump embraced a ceasefire proposal backed by Kyiv and European leaders to freeze the conflict on the current front line.</p>
<p>&quot;Let it be cut the way it is,&quot; he said. &quot;I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia has repeatedly pushed back against freezing the current line of contact.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that &quot;the consistency of Russia&#x27;s position doesn&#x27;t change&quot; - referring to Moscow&#x27;s insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.</p>
<p>Moscow was only interested in &quot;long-term, sustainable peace&quot;, Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.</p>
<p>The &quot;root causes of the conflict&quot; needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine - a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, European leaders put out a statement with Zelensky saying that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line and accused Russia of not being &quot;serious&quot; about peace.</p>
<p>Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August during a hastily organised summit which yielded no concrete results.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Third survivor quits grooming gang inquiry panel</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykd173l3vo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> - None</em></p>

<p>A third abuse survivor has resigned from their role in the government&#x27;s inquiry into grooming gangs.</p>
<p>&quot;Elizabeth&quot; - not her real name - joined Fiona Goddard and Ellie Reynolds, who quit the inquiry&#x27;s victims and survivors liaison panel on Monday in protest.</p>
<p>In her resignation letter, Elizabeth said the process felt like &quot;a cover-up&quot; and had &quot;created a toxic environment for survivors&quot;.</p>
<p>Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has denied claims of a cover-up and insisted her government was &quot;committed to exposing the failures&quot; to tackle &quot;these appalling crimes&quot;.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who is from Rotherham, said she felt the process had been &quot;scripted and predetermined&quot;, &quot;rather than emerging from honest, open dialogue with survivors&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This sense of control and stage-management has left many of us questioning whether our voices truly matter, or whether we are being used to legitimise decisions that have already been made,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Survivors have been concerned that if people are already giving up on the inquiry it will not be able to gain the trust and confidence of others affected.</p>
<p>There is also frustration around the length of time it has taking to appoint a chairperson, with some seeing this as a delay tactic because of fears of what might be exposed.</p>
<p>The government is under pressure to come up with a plan that satisfies the survivors at the heart of this scandal.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced in June there would be a national inquiry into grooming gangs covering England and Wales, with a panel of survivors set up to oversee the process.</p>
<p>However, a chairperson has yet to be appointed.</p>
<p>The BBC has been told former senior social worker Annie Hudson, who had been named as a potential chairperson, has withdrawn following recent media coverage over her candidacy.</p>
<p>One of the other names being considered is former deputy chief constable Jim Gamble.</p>
<p>A meeting between Mr Gamble and survivors took place earlier, with both sides said to have listened to each other&#x27;s perspectives.</p>
<p>Ms Goddard and Ms Reynolds had raised concerns about the suitability of the candidates shortlisted to chair the inquiry, arguing they should not have a background in policing or social work.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>The deal that means Prince Andrew can still afford to live in Royal Lodge</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmx1gxv1e7o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_a48506b8aead.webp'></p>
<p>More details have emerged about how Prince Andrew can afford his sprawling 30-room Windsor mansion, in a lease agreement which has been revealed.</p>
<p>The arrangement means he has only ever paid a token annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate, a document seen by BBC News confirms.</p>
<p>The deal meant that instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments up-front, including for renovations.</p>
<p>In effect, those payments - which totalled around £8m - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the 75-year lease.</p>
<p>Details about Prince Andrew&#x27;s living arrangements have been scrutinised as controversy continues over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a scandal which has been reignited by new sexual abuse allegations contained in Virginia Giuffre&#x27;s posthumously-published memoir.</p>
<p>While Prince Andrew has always strenuously denied abusing Giuffre, fresh questions have been asked in recent days about how he is able to fund his lifestyle despite not being a working royal.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew, who gave up titles including the Duke of York last week, signed the lease agreement on his home in 2003 with his landlord, the Crown Estate, which operates as an independent property company.</p>
<p>The Grade II-listed Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate boasts a gardener&#x27;s cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew&#x27;s rent is described as a &quot;peppercorn&quot;, which means a small sum such as £1, which can be paid every year on a long lease, as part of a legal arrangement between a tenant and the landlord. Or in his case there was no payment at all.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not about making a profit but is a symbolic payment, in this case from Prince Andrew to the Crown Estate.</p>
<p>This ongoing arrangement poses a problem for the Royal Family: with Prince Andrew mired in scandal, it is a terrible look to have him living among them in Windsor in apparent splendour.</p>
<p>The lease document also show Prince Andrew has to keep paying for the upkeep of Royal Lodge, ensuring the exterior stonework is in good condition every five years and painting the interior every seven years.</p>
<p>He has to &quot;paint, paper, polish, decorate&quot; to keep the house in good condition and to keep the landscaped grounds and gardens in good order. Prince Andrew, as the tenant, also has to allow his landlords to inspect and make sure he is keeping to the terms of the lease.</p>
<p>Other details revealed in the lease include clauses specifying that no helicopters are able to land there, and no gambling is allowed on the premises.</p>
<p>Information separately published by the National Audit Office shows Prince Andrew had to pay for £5 million worth of repairs, £2.5 million for the option of buying out future rent and a further £1 million premium to the Crown Estate.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Staff skipped checks and said a vulnerable young woman was safe. Days later, she was dead</h2>

<p>Warning: The following article contains details about suicide which some may find distressing</p>
<p>Cerys Lupton-Jones pauses between two doorways.</p>
<p>One door leads into a side room in the Manchester mental health unit where she&#x27;s a patient. The other leads into a toilet.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old had tried to end her life just 20 minutes earlier - but no staff are seen on the CCTV footage from inside the unit.</p>
<p>She hesitates for about 30 seconds, walking backwards and forwards. Then she enters the toilet and shuts the door.</p>
<p>The next time she is seen on the footage, doctors and nurses are fighting to resuscitate her.</p>
<p>Cerys dies five days later, on 18 May 2022.</p>
<p>A coroner has concluded that some of the care Cerys was given at Park House, which was run by the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, was a &quot;shambles&quot;.</p>
<p>Staff were meant to be checking on her every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>But the last recorded observation - at 15:00 - had been falsified, saying she had been seen in a corridor. CCTV shows at that point, Cerys was already in the toilet where she would fatally harm herself.</p>
<p>A staff member who was supposed to be looking after her has now admitted to falsifying these records.</p>
<p>Zak Golombeck, coroner for Manchester, said that if someone had stayed with her after the earlier attempt to take her life, what followed may never have happened. He said neglect was likely to have contributed to her death.</p>
<p>Campaigners are calling for an inquiry into the number of deaths at the mental health trust and believe the services are in crisis.</p>
<p>Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust said it &quot;failed her that day, and we are so very sorry that we did not do more&quot;.</p>
<p>Cerys&#x27;s parents, Rebecca Lupton and Dave Jones, describe their daughter as a loving young woman who would do anything for her friends. She was studying to be a nurse and was months away from completing her degree, with a job lined up.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Boris Johnson left the Covid Inquiry in a hurry - he&#x27;ll be pleased not to come back</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6nennz0nyo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_ee71a2aab1a8.webp'></p>
<p>Papers in hand, Boris Johnson arrived at the Covid Inquiry before the sun came up.</p>
<p>He was there to answer questions on decisions he made during the pandemic that directly impacted children.</p>
<p>School attendance, behaviour, screen time, speech and language - we now know the pandemic had an enduring effect on all of these issues for children.</p>
<p>Demand for speech and language support increased markedly after the pandemic. The amount of children who are persistently absent from school is still stubbornly high. And school suspensions and exclusions have hit record levels.</p>
<p>Each of these issues can be traced back to a part of the pandemic which has been central to this session of the inquiry: the closure of schools.</p>
<p>The decision to shut schools was one described by Boris Johnson on Tuesday as a &quot;personal horror&quot; for him, a &quot;nightmare idea&quot;, but one which he also said seemed like the only option at the time.</p>
<p>We know that, in March 2020, the government was still maintaining an almost total focus on efforts to keep schools open.</p>
<p>But last week the former education secretary Gavin Williamson told the inquiry ministers should have &quot;bitten the bullet&quot; and done more to prepare for school closures.</p>
<p>We heard in earlier evidence given to the inquiry that there wasn&#x27;t even a plan for the closure of schools until the day before it was announced on 18 March 2020.</p>
<p>This was described as an &quot;extraordinary dereliction of duty&quot; in the evidence of Sir Jon Coles, chief executive of the United Learning trust.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, the former PM pushed back on that claim.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the sequence from February onwards, it&#x27;s clear that Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) is talking about the possibility, the Cabinet is discussing it in March. Certainly I remember the subject coming up repeatedly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It is right to say Sage had referenced the prospect of &quot;mass school closures&quot; in February 2020.</p>
<p>But the top civil servant at the Department for Education (DfE) at the time, Jonathan Slater, wrote in his evidence submitted to the inquiry that &quot;DfE&#x27;s contingency plans were premised on the assumption that schools (and other education settings) would remain open&quot;.</p>
<p>And Williamson told the inquiry last week that his ability to plan for closures was impeded by Downing Street.</p>
