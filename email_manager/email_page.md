# Email Newsletter Design Specification: Two-Feature Model

This specification details the structure and content of the daily personalized email newsletter, designed to maximize in-email value while driving users back to the static site for quizzes and archive exploration.

**Goal:** Deliver two substantial, personalized articles (500-700 words each) and a curated menu of additional links.

## 1. Global Parameters & Personalization

|

| Element | Specification | Rationale |

| Delivery Model | Daily, via ESP (e.g., Buttondown). | Consistent engagement schedule. |

| Article Content | Full text (500â€“700 words) for the two featured stories. | High value, allows for offline reading (e.g., Kindle). |

| Level Targeting | Must display the user's selected reading level (e.g., "Grade 5"). | Core personalization element. Content simplification is based on this level. |

| Image Source | Custom image generated by the backend VM for the user's specific reading level. | Ensures age-appropriate and engaging visuals. |

| Mobile Optimization | Single-column layout, large text/buttons. | Essential for modern email consumption. |

## 2. Email Structure: Top-Down Flow

### A. Header & Branding

- **Logo/Title:** Prominent brand identity (`NEWS FOR KIDS`).
- **Greeting:** Personalized welcome that reinforces the reading level, e.g., "Here is your news for the day, **Grade 5** reader!"
- **Unsubscribe Link:** Must be clearly visible at the top (and bottom) for compliance.

### B. FEATURE 1: Primary News Story (High-Priority)

This story is drawn from the **News** category (Category 1).

- **Visual Block:** Contained in a distinct, light-colored block (Design B).
- **Title:** Large, bold headline.
- **Level Badge:** Small tag (e.g., `Grade 5`) displayed next to the title or over the image.
- **Generated Image:** Full-width (max 600px) and placed prominently at the top of the feature block.
- **Article Body:** The full 500â€“700 words of simplified text.
- **Primary CTA (Call-to-Action) Buttons:**
  1. **Start the Quiz ðŸ§ :** Primary, high-contrast button. Links directly to the quiz page on the static site (`/practice/[slug]`).
  2. **Read Full Article Page ðŸ“š:** Secondary button. Links to the full article page (`/articles/[slug]`).

### C. FEATURE 2: Secondary Catalog Story

This story is drawn from the **Science/Tech** or other primary catalog category (Category 2).

- **Visual Block:** Separated visually from Feature 1 (e.g., using the email's default white background).
- **Content:** Follows the identical Title, Image, Body, and CTA structure as Feature 1.
- **Goal:** Provide diversity and encourage exploration of evergreen content.

### D. Navigation Menu: Additional Links

This section lists the two next-latest articles from each of the three currently supported categories that were *not* featured in the main body (a total of 6 links).

- **Headline:** "More Stories to Explore on the Site"
- **Structure:** Organized under three distinct headings for clarity:

| Category Heading | Articles Listed (2 Titles Each) |

| News | 

$$Title 3 Link$$

 and 

$$Title 4 Link$$

 |

| Science | 

$$Title 3 Link$$

 and 

$$Title 4 Link$$

 |

| Sports | 

$$Title 1 Link$$

 and 

$$Title 2 Link$$

 |

All titles link directly to the full article page (`/articles/[slug]`) on the static site.
