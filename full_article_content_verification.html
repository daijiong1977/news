President Trump expressed doubt that Ukraine could defeat Russia and win back all the land Moscow has seized since it first invaded in 2014. His renewed skepticism comes following his meeting on Friday with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in which Trump declined Ukraine’s requests for long range missiles. Nick Schifrin reports.

Geoff Bennett:

President Trump today expressed doubt that Ukraine could defeat Russia and win back all the land Moscow has seized since it first invaded in 2014.

Amna Nawaz:

The president's renewed skepticism comes after his Friday meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Mr. Trump declined Ukraine's request for long-range missiles.

Nick Schifrin has the details.

Nick Schifrin:

On Ukraine's front lines this weekend: A woman lay badly wounded a few feet from the victim of a Russian gunshot. They and many Ukrainians tonight fear they must fend for themselves amid fallout from Friday's Cabinet Room meeting with President Trump.

Donald Trump, President of the United States: We would much rather have them not need Tomahawks.

Nick Schifrin:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived hoping for American Tomahawk cruise missiles, whose range can reach well beyond Moscow. But President Trump said no for now.</div>

We start the day's other headlines in Paris.

The Louvre remained closed today as investigators hunt for those responsible for yesterday's daylight heist of some of that nation's most precious jewels. Officials say the daring break-in lasted less than eight minutes. And, in the hours since, the museum has faced sharp criticism over its security.

Sam Holder of Independent Television News reports from the scene in Paris.

Sam Holder:

It's the world's most visited museum. But, for now, the crowds are outside the Louvre, the star attraction a boarded-up window, the heart of a heist so audacious, it could be from a blockbuster.

On Sunday morning, when the museum was open and filled with visitors, the calls began to evacuate, most unaware that a heist of historic proportions was under way, thieves smashing through two display cabinets to snatch priceless royal jewels.

Amongst the stolen haul, this emerald necklace worn by Napoleon Bonaparte's wife, this tiara resplendent with pearls and this brooch dripping in diamonds. In total, eight items are missing.

Peter Hicks, Historian:

Well, it's like the stealing of the crown jewels. It's the kings, the queens of France wore these things. Paris is a bit in shock.

Sam Holder:

The robbery began at 9:30 a.m., the target, the Gallery of Apollo. The four thieves used a van with a mechanical ladder to reach the window. Two cut through the glass with a disc cutter and entered. The theft unfolded just 250 meters from the Mona Lisa.</div>

Amna Nawaz:

Colombia recalled its ambassador to the United States today amid rising tensions between the two countries after U.S. military strikes took out what the Trump administration claimed were drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean.

But over the weekend, a very public spat broke out between the country's leaders, with Gustavo Petro of Colombia accusing President Trump of murdering a Colombian fisherman in one of those strikes and Trump calling Petro an illegal drug dealer.

Ivan Duque ]was the president of Colombia from 2018 to 2022, and he joins us tonight from Bogota, Colombia.

President Duque, welcome to the "News Hour." Thank you for joining us.

Ivan Duque, Former Colombian President:

Amna, thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be here with you.

Amna Nawaz:

So your successor, President Petro, has now accused U.S. President Trump of murder. He also says the U.S. is violating Colombian sovereignty with those strikes. Do you agree with those accusations?</div>

Republicans in North Carolina moved forward with a plan to redraw the state’s congressional map and eliminate its only swing district. It's part of a GOP push to maintain control of Congress through maps that have the effect of diluting Black political power and diminishing the voting strength of communities of color. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

Geoff Bennett:

Republican lawmakers in North Carolina moved forward with a proposal today to redraw their state's congressional map in a way that would eliminate its only swing district.

The mid-decade redistricting is part of a nationwide push by President Trump and his Republican allies to help the GOP maintain control of Congress in next year's elections, often through maps that have the effect of diluting Black political power and diminishing the voting strength of communities of color.

Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court appeared willing to issue a ruling that could further that effort during arguments in a Louisiana redistricting case.

NAACP Legal Defense Fund president Janai Nelson argued the case before the court in defense of Louisiana voters, and she joins us now.

Thanks for being with us.

Janai Nelson, President and Director-Counsel, NAACP Legal Defense Fund: Thank you. Happy to be here.

Geoff Bennett:

So what was the main argument you presented before the court in defense of the existing Louisiana map that includes two majority-Black districts? What did you want the justices to understand about the stakes?

In the Arctic tundra of Alaska, climate change is forcing an Alaskan Native village to relocate. Rising temperatures are melting the ice under the ground called permafrost. The melted ice then mixes with the soil, creating unstable land. The Yup'ik people call it Alaskan quicksand.

From Alaska, Amalia Huot-Marchand and a team from the Medill School of Journalism report.

Edna Chase, Resident of Nunapitchuk, Alaska: The houses, it's sinking. Every year, my floor falls six inches all around the house.

Amalia Huot-Marchand:

Edna Chase, 60 years old, lives in the Alaskan village of Nunapitchuk. She's been in this home for 53 years, but now, due to rising temperatures, the permafrost underground is melting. Her house is sinking in what they call Alaskan quicksand.

Edna Chase:

There's no more foundation. It's under the ground. I have got three floors, two underwater, and the top one can't dry. Sometimes, I have to have five fans going. Man, it stinks in here.</div>

                        New method extracts desirable elements from waste magnets using less energy and acid.

            <div class="field-content">New method extracts desirable elements from waste magnets using less energy and acid.

All the world’s discarded phones, bricked laptops, and other trashed electronics are collectively a treasure trove of rare earth elements (REEs). But separating out and recovering these increasingly sought-after materials is no easy task.

However, a team of researchers says it has developed a way of separating REEs from waste—magnets, in this case—that is relatively easy, uses less energy, and isn’t nearly as emissions and pollution intensive as current methods. The team published a paper describing this method in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In short, this process involves using an electric current to heat waste magnets to very high temperatures very fast, and using chlorine gas to react with the non-REEs in the mix, keeping them in the vapor phase. James Tour, one of the authors and a professor of materials science and nanoengineering at Rice University, says that the research can help the United States meet its growing need for these elements.

“The country’s scurrying to try to see how we can get these [REEs],” he says. “And, in our argument, it’s all in our waste… We have it right here, just pull it right back out of the waste.”

In 2018, Tour and his colleagues discovered that this rapid heating process, called flash joule heating, can turn any carbon source—including coal, biochar, and mixed plastic—into graphene, a very thin, strong, and conductive material.

Building on this, in 2023, they developed a method that uses flash joule heating and chlorine. In this work, they identified the Gibbs free energy, the reactivity of a material, for the oxide form of all 17 REEs and nine common oxides found in REE waste.

Ground-up waste magnets are put on a platform made of carbon and surrounded by a glass chamber. A current runs through the platform, rapidly producing immense heat, thousands of degrees celsius in a matter of seconds. Chlorine gas is then released into the chamber, creating chlorides of unwanted elements like iron and lowering their boiling points.

Between the chlorine gas and the heat, the non-REE components vaporize and form deposits on the interior of the chamber. The REEs are left behind in oxide or oxychloride form on the carbon platform, ready to be collected.

The team studied the differences in reactivity with chlorine gas and the difference of boiling points between the oxide and chloride forms of the metals—iron’s boiling point is around 3,000° C, while iron chloride’s boiling point is only 315° C—as they “probed around” and tested different voltages and temperatures on neodymium-iron-boron and samarium-cobalt magnet waste.

Because magnets are hard, they were heated to 800° C to demagnetize and soften them prior to grinding them to dust. The separated REE residue at the end of the process can be remagnetized by exposing them to a magnet.

The end result is more than 90 percent pure and recovers more than 90 percent of the REEs from the waste magnets. Tour adds that the method could be used on different forms of e-waste, not just magnets.

Tour and his colleagues also ran a life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis, comparing their method to a common method of recovering REEs from waste. Called hydrometallurgical extraction, it requires a fair amount of energy and the use of a lot of acids and solvents. “It’s a messy, messy process,” he says.

The team’s analysis suggests that the method involving Fast Joule Heating and chlorine gas reduces energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission, and operating costs by 87, 84, and 54 percent, respectively.

In 2022 alone, the world produced 66.2 million tonnes of this e-waste. Metal, unlike plastic, is infinitely recyclable, and the concentration of REEs in e-waste is much higher than occurs naturally. The two main ways of mining REEs both release toxic chemicals into surrounding environments. Setting up a mine is also very expensive, Tour adds.</div>

            <div class="field-content">Guppies are highly susceptible to the Ebbinghaus illusion. Ring doves? Not so much.

Chances are you’ve encountered some version of the “Ebbinghaus illusion,” in which a central circle appears to be smaller when encircled by larger circles and seems larger when surrounded by smaller circles. It’s an example of context-dependent size perception. But is this unique to humans or are some animals susceptible as well? According to a new paper published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, it might depend on the specific sensory environment, since the illusion relies on contextual clues to be effective.

Prior research has produced mixed results on the question of animals and their susceptibility to optical illusions, per the authors. Dolphins, chicks, and redtail splitfins seem to be susceptible, for example, while pigeons, baboons, and gray bamboo snakes are not.

Perhaps the best-known example is cats’ undeniable love of boxes and squares—the “if it fits, I sits” phenomenon documented all over the Internet. This behavior is generally attributed to the fact that cats feel safer when squeezed into small spaces, but it also tells us something about feline visual perception. A 1988 study and a 2021 study concluded that cats are susceptible to the Kanizsa square illusion, suggesting that they perceive subjective contours much like humans.

The authors of this latest paper decided to test the Ebbinghaus illusion across two species that inhabit very different sensory environments: ring doves and guppies. The doves are terrestrial, pecking at small seeds scattered on the ground for food, so the authors reasoned that precision and attention to detail—rather than global processing to first analyze an entire scene, as humans do—would be more advantageous for the doves. Plus the doves have binocular vision and thus should be good at accurately judging size and distance.

Guppies, by contrast, live in the shallow waters of tropical streams. They must contend with dense vegetation, flickering light, and the unpredictability of predators. They must make rapid decisions in order to survive, and thus it would be advantageous for guppies to be able to judge relative size at a glance—a human-like global processing ability that is key to the Ebbinghaus illusion.

The authors tested 38 ring doves and 19 guppies (of the “snakeskin cobra green” ornamental strain) for their experiments. The doves were placed in a testing cage with the bottom covered with an anti-slip wooden panel and a branch serving as a perch and starting point; the feeding station was at the opposite end of the cage. The guppies were tested in single tanks with a gravel bottom.

In both cases, the test subjects were presented with visual stimuli in the form of two white plastic cards. Sizes differed for the doves and the guppies, but each card showed an array of six black circles with a bit of food serving as the center “circle”: red millet seeds for the doves and commercial flake food for the guppies. The circles were smaller on one of the cards and larger on the other. The subjects were free to choose food from one of the cards, and the card with the unchosen food was removed promptly. If no choice was made after 15 minutes, the trial was null and the team tried again after a 15-minute interval.

The authors found that the guppies were indeed highly susceptible to the Ebbinghaus illusion, choosing food surrounded by smaller circles much more frequently, suggesting they perceived it as larger and hence more desirable. The results for ring doves were more mixed, however: some of the doves seemed to be susceptible while others were not, suggesting that their perceptual strategies are more local, detail-oriented, and less influenced by their surrounding context.

“The doves’ mixed responses suggest that individual experience or innate bias can strongly shape how an animal interprets illusions,” the authors concluded. “Just like in humans, where some people are strongly fooled by illusions and others hardly at all, animal perception is not uniform.”

The authors acknowledge that their study has limitations. For instance, guppies and ring doves diverged hundreds of millions of years ago and hence are phylogenetically distant, so the perceptual differences between them could be due not just to ecological pressures, but also to evolutionary traits gained or lost via natural selection. Future experiments involving more closely related species with different sensory environments would better isolate the role of ecological factors in animal perception.

            <div class="field-content">Ars chats with co-authors Lindsey Fitzharris and Adrian Teal about their delightful new children’s book.

In 1890, a German scientist named Robert Koch thought he’d invented a cure for tuberculosis, a substance derived from the infecting bacterium itself that he dubbed Tuberculin. His substance didn’t actually cure anyone, but it was eventually widely used as a diagnostic skin test. Koch’s successful failure is just one of the many colorful cases featured in Dead Ends! Flukes, Flops, and Failures that Sparked Medical Marvels, a new nonfiction illustrated children’s book by science historian Lindsey Fitzharris and her husband, cartoonist Adrian Teal.

A noted science communicator with a fondness for the medically macabre, Fitzharris published a biography of surgical pioneer Joseph Lister, The Butchering Art, in 2017—a great, if occasionally grisly, read. She followed up with 2022’s  The Facemaker: A Visionary Surgeon’s Battle to Mend the Disfigured Soldiers of World War I, about a WWI surgeon named Harold Gillies who rebuilt the faces of injured soldiers.

And in 2020, she hosted a documentary for the Smithsonian Channel, The Curious Life and Death Of…, exploring famous deaths, ranging from drug lord Pablo Escobar to magician Harry Houdini. Fitzharris performed virtual autopsies, experimented with blood samples, interviewed witnesses, and conducted real-time demonstrations in hopes of gleaning fresh insights. For his part, Teal is a well-known caricaturist and illustrator, best known for his work on the British TV series Spitting Image. His work has also appeared in The Guardian and the Sunday Telegraph, among other outlets.

The couple decided to collaborate on children’s books as a way to combine their respective skills. Granted, “[The market for] children’s nonfiction is very difficult,” Fitzharris told Ars. “It doesn’t sell that well in general. It’s very difficult to get publishers on board with it. It’s such a shame because I really feel that there’s a hunger for it, especially when I see the kids picking up these books and loving it. There’s also just a need for it with the decline in literacy rates. We need to get people more engaged with these topics in ways that go beyond a 30-second clip on TikTok.”

Their first foray into the market was 2023’s Plague-Busters! Medicine’s Battles with History’s Deadliest Diseases, exploring “the ickiest illnesses that have infected humans and affected civilizations through the ages”—as well as the medical breakthroughs that came about to combat those diseases. Dead Ends is something of a sequel, focusing this time on historical diagnoses, experiments, and treatments that were useless at best, frequently harmful, yet eventually led to unexpected medical breakthroughs.

The book opens with the story of Robert Liston, a 19th-century Scottish surgeon known as “the fastest knife in the West End,” because he could amputate a leg in less than three minutes. That kind of speed was desirable in a period before the discovery of anesthetic, but sometimes Liston’s rapid-fire approach to surgery backfired. One story (possibly apocryphal) holds that Liston accidentally cut off the finger of his assistant in the operating theater as he was switching blades, then accidentally cut the coat of a spectator, who died of fright. The patient and assistant also died, so that operation is now often jokingly described as the only one with a 300 percent mortality rate, per Fitzharris.

Liston is the ideal poster child for the book’s theme of celebrating the role of failure in scientific progress. “I’ve always felt that failure is something we don’t talk about enough in the history of science and medicine,” said Fitzharris. “For everything that’s succeeded there’s hundreds, if not thousands, of things that’s failed. I think it’s a great concept for children. If you think that you’ve made mistakes, look at these great minds from the past. They’ve made some real whoppers. You are in good company. And failure is essential to succeeding, especially in science and medicine.”

“During the COVID pandemic, a lot of people were uncomfortable with the fact that some of the advice would change, but to me that was a comfort because that’s what you want to see scientists and doctors doing,” she continued. “They’re learning more about the virus, they’re changing their advice. They’re adapting. I think that this book is a good reminder of what the scientific process involves.”

The details of Liston’s most infamous case might be horrifying, but as Teal observes, “Comedy equals tragedy plus time.” One of the reasons so many of his patients died was because this was before the broad acceptance of germ theory and Joseph Lister’s pioneering work on antiseptic surgery. Swashbuckling surgeons like Liston prided themselves on operating in coats stiffened with blood—the sign of a busy and hence successful surgeon. Frederick Treves once observed that in the operating room, “cleanliness was out of place. It was cons</div>

The Orion spacecraft, which will fly four people around the Moon, arrived inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida late Thursday night, ready to be stacked on top of its rocket for launch early next year.

The late-night transfer covered about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from one facility to another at the Florida spaceport. NASA and its contractors are continuing preparations for the Artemis II mission after the White House approved the program as an exception to work through the ongoing government shutdown, which began on October 1.

The sustained work could set up Artemis II for a launch opportunity as soon as February 5 of next year. Astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen will be the first humans to fly on the Orion spacecraft, a vehicle that has been in development for nearly two decades. The Artemis II crew will make history on their 10-day flight by becoming the first people to travel to the vicinity of the Moon since 1972.

The Orion spacecraft, developed by Lockheed Martin, has made several stops at Kennedy over the last few months since leaving its factory in May.

First, the capsule moved to a fueling facility, where technicians filled it with hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants, which will feed Orion’s main engine and maneuvering thrusters on the flight to the Moon and back. In the same facility, teams loaded high-pressure helium and ammonia coolant into Orion propulsion and thermal control systems.

The next stop was a nearby building where the Launch Abort System was installed on the Orion spacecraft. The tower-like abort system would pull the capsule away from its rocket in the event of a launch failure. Orion stands roughly 67 feet (20 meters) tall with its service module, crew module, and abort tower integrated together.

Teams at Kennedy also installed four ogive panels to serve as an aerodynamic shield over the Orion crew capsule during the first few minutes of launch.

It was then time to move Orion to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), where a separate team has worked all year to stack the elements of NASA’s Space Launch System rocket. In the coming days, cranes will lift the spacecraft, weighing 78,000 pounds (35 metric tons), dozens of stories above the VAB’s center aisle, then up and over the transom into the building’s northeast high bay to be lowered atop the SLS heavy-lift rocket.

Workers will methodically tighten 360 bolts to firmly connect the Orion spacecraft to the Space Launch System. Once complete, NASA will have the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) rocket and spacecraft for Artemis II fully assembled for final tests and checkouts inside the VAB, the same structure used to ready space shuttles and Moon-bound Apollo missions for flight in past eras of human spaceflight.

One of the most critical activities planned in the VAB is a countdown rehearsal with the four-person Artemis II crew. The astronauts will take their seats inside the Orion spacecraft and practice their launch-day procedures, which include configuring the craft’s cockpit for flight. The rocket won’t be fueled for this event.

Other tasks planned for the rest of the year include testing of the rocket’s destruct system, which would be used if the vehicle flies off course after liftoff. NASA will then be ready to roll the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft to Launch Complex 39B, probably sometime in January if the mission holds to its February 5 target launch date.

At the pad, NASA will run the rocket through a practice countdown. This time, the rocket will be fueled with super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to make sure everything is in good shape for launch day. This is the same test that uncovered persistent hydrogen fuel leaks on the SLS rocket before the first unpiloted Artemis test flight in 2022.

Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s Artemis II launch director, said last month that officials believe the hydrogen leak problem has been “put to bed” after changing the design of a leaky valve and demonstrating a gentler fueling procedure during the Artemis I countdown three years ago.

If the countdown rehearsal goes well, the launch team and rocket will be ready for the real launch attempt a few days later. Officials don’t plan to return the rocket to the VAB unless they uncover a major problem at the pad.</div>

            <div class="field-content">A recent study found lead in teeth from 2 million-year-old hominin fossils.

Our hominid ancestors faced a Pleistocene world full of dangers—and apparently one of those dangers was lead poisoning.

Lead exposure sounds like a modern problem, at least if you define “modern” the way a paleoanthropologist might: a time that started a few thousand years ago with ancient Roman silver smelting and lead pipes. According to a recent study, however, lead is a much more ancient nemesis, one that predates not just the Romans but the existence of our genus Homo. Paleoanthropologist Renaud Joannes-Boyau of Australia’s Southern Cross University and his colleagues found evidence of exposure to dangerous amounts of lead in the teeth of fossil apes and hominins dating back almost 2 million years. And somewhat controversially, they suggest that the toxic element’s pervasiveness may have helped shape our evolutionary history.

Joannes-Boyau and his colleagues took tiny samples of preserved enamel and dentin from the teeth of 51 fossils. In most of those teeth, the paleoanthropologists found evidence that these apes and hominins had been exposed to lead—sometimes in dangerous quantities—fairly often during their early years.

Tooth enamel forms in thin layers, a little like tree rings, during the first six or so years of a person’s life. The teeth in your mouth right now (and of which you are now uncomfortably aware; you’re welcome) are a chemical and physical record of your childhood health—including, perhaps, whether you liked to snack on lead paint chips. Bands of lead-tainted tooth enamel suggest that a person had a lot of lead in their bloodstream during the year that layer of enamel was forming (in this case, “a lot” means an amount measurable in parts per million).

In 71 percent of the hominin teeth that Joannes-Boyau and his colleagues sampled, dark bands of lead in the tooth enamel showed “clear signs of episodic lead exposure” during the crucial early childhood years. Those included teeth from 100,000-year-old members of our own species found in China and 250,000-year-old French Neanderthals. They also included much earlier hominins who lived between 1 and 2 million years ago in South Africa: early members of our genus Homo, along with our relatives Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus. Lead exposure, it turns out, is a very ancient problem.

This study isn’t the first evidence that ancient hominins dealt with lead in their environments. Two Neanderthals living 250,000 years ago in France experienced lead exposure as young children, according to a 2018 study. At the time, they were the oldest known examples of lead exposure (and they’re included in Joannes-Boyau and his colleagues’ recent study).

Until a few thousand years ago, no one was smelting silver, plumbing bathhouses, or releasing lead fumes in car exhaust. So how were our hominin ancestors exposed to the toxic element? Another study, published in 2015, showed that the Spanish caves occupied by other groups of Neanderthals contained enough heavy metals, including lead, to “meet the present-day standards of ‘contaminated soil.’”

Today, we mostly think of lead in terms of human-made pollution, so it’s easy to forget that it’s also found naturally in bedrock and soil. If that weren’t the case, archaeologists couldn’t use lead isotope ratios to tell where certain artifacts were made. And some places—and some types of rock—have higher lead concentrations than others. Several common minerals contain lead compounds, including galena or lead sulfide. And the kind of lead exposure documented in Joannes-Boyau and his colleagues’ study would have happened at an age when little hominins were very prone to putting rocks, cave dirt, and other random objects in their mouths.

Some of the fossils from the Queque cave system in China, which included a 1.8 million-year-old extinct gorilla-like ape called Gigantopithecus blacki, had lead levels higher than 50 parts per million, which Joannes-Boyau and his colleagues describe as “a substantial level of lead that could have triggered some developmental, health, and perhaps social impairments.”

Even for ancient hominins who weren’t living in caves full of lead-rich minerals, wildfires, or volcanic eruptions can also release lead particles into the air, and erosion or flooding can sweep buried lead-rich rock or sediment into water sources. If you’re an Australopithecine living upstream of a lead-rich mica outcropping, for example, erosion might sprinkle poison into your drinking water—or the drinking water of the gazelle you eat or the root system of the bush you get those tasty berries from… .

Our world is full of poisons. Modern humans may have made a habit of digging them up and pumping them into the air, but they’ve always been lying in wait for the unwary.

            <div class="field-content">Ariarne Titmus Confirms Withdrawal From Anti-Doping Testing Pool

Just a handful of days after announcing her surprise retirement from the sport, reports from Australia indicate that Ariarne Titmus has officially been withdrawn from the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA) testing pool. According to 7News, Titmus received an email that confirmed she is no longer required to provide whereabouts information for out-of-competition testing.

“This news feels unreal,” Titmus said.

Last week, the Australian freestyle legend took to social media to announce she was walking away from the sport of swimming at the age of 25. A multi-time Olympic champion and world-record setter, Titmus initally planned to take a year off from competition after the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, and then return to training to chase a berth to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

However, Titmus found that the desire to compete at the highest level no longer burned and she opted to walk away from swimming at the peak of her career. Titmus is a lock to be a first-ballot selection for the International Swimming Hall of Fame and leaves the sport as an eight-time Olympic medalist, including back-to-back titles in the 400-meter freestyle at the 2020 and 2024 Games.

In announcing that she has notified anti-doping authorities of her retirement, Titmus indicated she was first tested as a 12-year-old, and missed a birthday party while providing her sample. In the 7News article, she noted that she had to begin providing whereabouts information when she was 15 years old.

Who will emerge on top of the points standings when the World Cup wraps up its three-meet tour of North America later this week? While the women’s battle for top honors is a tight affair between Americans Gretchen Walsh and Kate Douglass, the men’s standings are convincingly led by Hubert Kos, the reigning Olympic champion in the 200-meter backstroke.

Going into the Toronto stop of the circuit, which will be held from Thursday to Saturday, Walsh has the slightest edge on Douglass, 118.1 points to 118. Both women have been superb at the first two legs in Carmel (Ind.) and Westmont (Ill.), with Walsh sweeping the 100 individual medley, 50 butterfly and 100 butterfly. Douglass has been perfect in the 100 freestyle, 100 breaststroke and 200 breaststroke. Each athlete has set a world record, Walsh’s arriving in the 50 fly in Carmel and Douglass’ coming in Westmont in the 100 freestyle.

Regan Smith, with 114.4 points, sits in third place in the standings. During the World Cup, Smith has tied her world record in the 100 backstroke and set a pair of American records in the 200 butterfly. She also established an American record in the 200 backstroke on Sunday night, with her time better than the previous world record during a sensational duel with Aussie Kaylee McKeown.

In men’s action, Kos has a comfortable lead in the points standings over Canadian Ilya Kharun. Through the first two meets, Kos has not dropped a backstroke race, going 2-for-2 in the 50 backstroke, 100 backstroke and 200 backstroke. That excellence has enabled Kos to accumulate 116.4 points, which puts him ahead of Kharun and his 113.1 points. Shaine Casas follows in third place with 112.3 points.

            <div class="field-content">Schedule Released for 2026 Open Water Swimming World Cup

World Aquatics has announced the four stops of the Open Water Swimming World Cup, which will mark the 20th year of the tour. The series will begin with racing in the Red Sea and then shift to Europe for the final three legs. Racing is scheduled to take place between late March and mid-June, with the fields featuring many of the premier open-water swimmers in the world.

The calendar for the World Aquatics Open Water Swimming World Cup:

The fourth stop on the tour, Setubal, is always intriguing and captures the attention of the athletes due to it being one of the more strategic events. Breaking waves and currents often call for the swimmers to adjust their gameplans.

“You have to race and react with what the others are doing,” said Hungarian Kristof Rasovszky of the Setubal stop. “Of course, you have to catch up in the current, find your place in the waves and your place in the pack. Setubal is pure racing.”

The 2025 World Cup champions were recently crowned, with Italy’s Ginevra Tadeucci capturing the women’s title and Frenchman Logan Fontaine claiming the men’s championship.

            <div class="field-content">Storylines to Look Out for in SEC Swimming in 2025-26

With the college swimming season underway for the 2025-2026 year, there’s no shortage of storylines to follow. Between up and coming competitors, returning stars, new coaches and movement among conferences, this NCAA season should have it all. Here are a few storylines to follow in the Southeastern Conference.

Perhaps the biggest storyline this year centers on the University of Texas, which joined the SEC last season and immediately made its presence known. In their first year in the conference, the Longhorns won both the men’s and women’s titles, proving that their Big 12 reign could easily translate to the nation’s most competitive conference.

In addition to a strong core headlined by Jillian Cox and Erin Gemmell, the Texas women have one of the most powerful incoming classes in the SEC. Top recruits like Haley McDonald (2023 world junior silver medalist and two-time national junior team member), Avery Collins (two-time Junior Nationals finalist finalist), Sarah Rodrigues (2025 national junior team member) and Inez Miller (2024 Junior Pan Pacific Championships medalist) will be names to look out for. International freestylers Eva Okaro and Nikolett Padar are expected to make a huge impact right away.

After losing key competitors Bella Sims and Emma Weyant last year, Florida has also brought in a competitive freshman women’s class, led by IM specialists Lilla Bognar and Grace Rabb, world junior champion Lynsey Bowen, Trinidad and Tobago Olympian Zuri Ferguson and Lithuanian freestyler Sylvia Statkevicius.

On the men’s side, the Gator men’s team had dominated the SEC since 2012, but Texas came in to end its 12-year conference championship streak last year. Standout swimmers like Hubert Kos, Rex Maurer, Nate Germonprez and Will Modglin led the way for the Longhorns. Maurer won both the 500 freestyle and 400 IM, establishing himself as one of the SEC’s all-around talents. This year, the Gators return major contributors in Josh Liendo, Jonny Marshall and Scotty Buff, ensuring a showdown at the SEC Championships this year.

While Texas and Florida may dominate the leading headlines of SEC swimming, there are several other rising competitors to keep an eye out for heading into the season. Tennessee stood out at the start of SEC championships last season and finished third for both of their men’s and women’s teams.

The Lady Vols have remained a consistent force within the conference under head coach Matt Kredich, who just had his contract renewed through 2030. Kredich has brought in several new talents, including Lilly Daley from UF, Kamal Muhammad from UVA and Simoné Moll from Miami. Japan’s Mizuki Hirai is expected in the spring. On the men’s side, the Vols will add Ulises Saravia from Argentina and Ethan Dumesnil from France. They’re likely to make an impact this upcoming year.

Auburn’s women’s team is also a group to look out for after experiencing a large shift in its roster this past year. The Tigers had 13 women enter the transfer portal, the most from a single school and the most from an SEC school. The school will be looking to bounce back following an eighth-place finish at SECs for men and a ninth place finish for women. Head coach Ryan Wochomurka has brought in several talents to the men’s team, including Luke Bedsore, Maston Ballew, Mack Schumann and Daniel Krichevsky, who will add depth and energy to the team.

Impacts of NIL

Beyond the lanes, the growing influence of Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) opportunities are continuing to reshape collegiate athletics, especially for powerhouse conferences like the SEC. The SEC specifically, in fact, is one of the biggest spenders for college athletics. Although NIL hasn’t transformed swimming as much as it has for larger revenue sports such as basketball or football, there is still a huge impact on the environment of the sport. In several cases, effects of NIL has led to the elimination of non-revenue sports for certain colleges. This conflict and added pressure on the sport may be a factor to watch out for heading into this year.

            <div class="field-content">Hubert Kos, Torri Huske, Claire Curzan Have Decisions to Make After NCAA Schedule Change

Over the past several years, Hubert Kos and Torri Huske have established themselves securely among the world’s best swimmers, both having secured individual Olympic gold medals in Paris along with numerous other international medals before the end of their college careers. Claire Curzan is another current NCAA swimmer with a record of strong international achievement.

Three of the best current college swimmers and all with major decisions to make regarding their event lineups for this year’s NCAA Championships. The newly-adopted lineup of events creates conflicts for all three, virtually ruling out a repeat of the event programs they swam at the last edition of the meet in 2025. Individual success is on the line as well as team points; Curzan (Virginia) and Kos (Texas) are the leading returning scorers for the defending national champions while the Stanford women have big goals for Huske’s final year of eligibility.

Last season, Kos captured NCAA titles in the 200 IM, 100 backstroke and 200 backstroke. Now, with the 200 IM moved to the meet’s final day, he will almost certainly have to drop that event from his schedule to focus on his premier race, the one in which he swam the fastest time ever by more than a second in 2025. The new NCAA order of events projects an 81-minute finals session, meaning the 200 IM and 200 back finals would take place less than an hour apart. That is a big ask, even for a swimmer as accomplished as this Hungarian star.

If Kos indeed drops the 200 IM from his slate, he would be looking for another race, likely one of the individual races held Thursday. Kos is an accomplished 100 butterflyer, presenting that event as a natural option, and he did handle butterfly duties on both of Texas’ medley relays at last season’s NCAA Championships. On the 400 medley relay, Kos split 43.45, an exceptional time but behind the marks of Florida’s Josh Liendo, Arizona State’s Ilya Kharun, Georgia’s Luca Urlando and Cal’s Dare Rose, three of whom (all except Rose) will be back this year.

The new event lineup hurts Kos, and it would have been problematic for other standouts with skills in both the 200 IM and 200 back. Before Kos, the likes of Ryan Lochte (2005 and 2006), Missy Franklin (2015), Kathleen Baker (2017), Beata Nelson (2019), Shaine Casas (2021) and Destin Lasco (2024) won titles in both events at the same meet. Meanwhile, the 200 IM-200 fly double becomes even more impractical. It has been a long time since a male swimmer swept both events, but venerable females such as Katinka Hosszu (2011), Ella Eastin (2018) and Alex Walsh (2022) got wins in both events under the familiar old lineup.

Moving to mostly shorter races, the conflict for Huske would come on the final day of the women’s meet, with the 200 IM and 100 freestyle now scheduled to take place back-to-back. Last season, Huske took down Walsh for the NCAA crown in the 200 IM while also taking second behind Gretchen Walsh in the 100 free. Fortunately for Huske, the decision might not be too hard to make: she will likely drop the medley and pick up the 50 free, set for a day (Friday) when none of Huske’s other main events are held.

With the younger Walsh sister’s days of dominating the college sprints now concluded, Huske would be the significant favorite for national titles in both sprint freestyle races as well as the 100 fly. The switch would work out for Stanford as well; five of the eight swimmer’s in last year’s NCAA final of the 200 IM were in their final year of collegiate eligibility, and Huske’s withdrawal from the event would leave Stanford teammates Caroline Bricker and Lucy Bell as the only returning A-finalists.

Curzan’s event decision is probably a lower-stakes one given the depth of talent returning to the Cavaliers’ roster this season and the clarity of the events in which she is a true national contender. The backstroke events are now central to Curzan’s slate, and she is the reigning NCAA champion in the 100 and 200-yard races. She will surely swim both in 2026. The 50 free, however, is in question since it takes place the same day as the 100 back.

Curzan was second to Gretchen Walsh in the splash-and-dash last season, so she would be the top returning finisher, but the likely presence of Huske in that event complicates the situation. If Curzan raced the 50 free, she would enter fatigued in a likely-competitive final and the 400 medley relay still to come later in the session. Alternately, she could switch to the 100 fly, held on a day when she has no other individual races, and likely finish second behind Huske.

As for other multi-event stars returning to the college ranks, the new schedule works out much better. Liendo can continue racing the 100 fly plus the 50 and 100 free, all events in which he has won multiple times, with no conflicts. Kharun remains in good shape for </div>

            <div class="field-content">Ruling holds that defeating end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp harms Meta’s business.

A federal judge has ordered spyware maker NSO to stop using its Pegasus app to target or infect users of WhatsApp.

The ruling, issued Friday by Phyllis J. Hamilton of of the US District Court of the District of Northern California, grants a permanent injunction sought by WhatsApp owner Meta in a case it brought against NSO in 2019. The lawsuit alleged that Meta caught NSO trying to surreptitiously infect about 1,400 mobile phones—many belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials—with Pegasus. As part of the campaign, NSO created fake WhatsApp accounts and targeted Meta infrastructure. The suit sought monetary awards and an injunction against the practice.

Friday’s ruling ordered NSO to permanently cease targeting WhatsApp users, attempting to infect their devices, or intercepted WhatsApp messages, which are end-to-end encrypted using the open source Signal Protocol. Hamilton also ruled that NSO must delete any data it obtained when targeting the WhatsApp users.

NSO had argued that such a ruling would “force NSO out of business,” as Pegasus is its “flagship product.” Hamilton ruled that the harm Pegasus posed to Meta outweighed any such considerations.

“In the court’s view, any business that deals with users’ personal information, and that invests resources into ways to encrypt that personal information, is harmed by the unauthorized access of that personal information—and it is more than just a reputational harm, it’s a business harm,” Hamilton wrote. “Essentially, part of what companies such as Whatsapp are ‘selling’ is informational privacy, and any unauthorized access is an interference with that sale. Defendants’ conduct serves to defeat one of the purposes of the service being offered by plaintiffs, which constitutes direct harm.”

The judge went on to deny Meta’s request that the injunction bar foreign governments that may use WhatsApp. She said that sovereign governments weren’t parties to the lawsuit. Friday’s ruling also denied Meta’s request that the injunction bar NSO from targeting users of other Meta properties such as Facebook and Instagram on the grounds there was no evidence presented concerning targeting of them.

“Today’s ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again,” WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said in a statement. “We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society. It sets an important precedent that there are serious consequences to attacking an American company.”

Hamilton also slashed the punitive damages a jury awarded to Meta from $167 million to $4 million. The judge said the standard the jury based the amount on wasn’t proper. Under the correct standard, punitive damages must be capped at $4 million, she said.

Pegasus is among the most advanced means of surveilling iPhones and Android devices. Pegasus often infects devices using “zero-click” exploits, meaning they require no interaction on the part of targeted users. Both Apple and Google expend significant resources to secure their operating systems; Pegasus defeats these defenses by spending large sums reverse engineering the OSes.

NSO has said that it licenses Pegasus only to governments that a careful vetting shows don’t abuse their use of the spyware. As was demonstrated in the WhatsApp case, dissidents, journalists, and others have been targeted anyway.

The ruling is significant because, as Carthcart noted, it sets a precedent that other US parties who are in the same position as Meta can cite in any cases they bring against NSO.

NSO didn’t answer an email seeking comment.

                        "The president wants to make sure we beat the Chinese."

            <div class="field-content">“The president wants to make sure we beat the Chinese.”

NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy made two television appearances on Monday morning in which he shook up the space agency’s plans to return humans to the Moon.

Speaking on Fox News, where the secretary of transportation frequently appears in his acting role as NASA chief, Duffy said SpaceX has fallen behind in its efforts to develop the Starship vehicle as a lunar lander. Duffy also indirectly acknowledged that NASA’s projected target of a 2027 crewed lunar landing is no longer achievable. Accordingly, he said he intended to expand the competition to develop a lander capable of carrying humans down to the Moon from lunar orbit and back.

“They’re behind schedule, and so the President wants to make sure we beat the Chinese,” Duffy said of SpaceX. “He wants to get there in his term. So I’m in the process of opening that contract up. I think we’ll see companies like Blue [Origin] get involved, and maybe others. We’re going to have a space race in regard to American companies competing to see who can actually lead us back to the Moon first.”

There are a couple of significant takeaways from this interview. First is the public acknowledgement by a senior NASA official that the space agency’s current timeline of a 2027 landing is completely untenable. And secondly, the timing of Duffy’s public appearances on Monday morning seems tailored to influence a fierce, behind-the-scenes battle to hold onto the NASA leadership position.

SpaceX won a contract from NASA, worth $2.9 billion, in April 2021 to develop and modify its ambitious Starship rocket to serve as a “human landing system” (HLS). This rocket would work in concert with NASA’s Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft to get humans from Earth, to the lunar surface, and back. Two years later Blue Origin, a rocket company founded by Jeff Bezos, won a second contract, worth $3.4 billion to develop a second lander.

Duffy is correct that SpaceX is moving slower than anticipated. The company must still cross several technical hurdles before it can provide landing services to NASA. In their funded contracts for reusable landers, SpaceX and Blue Origin must refuel their vehicles in low-Earth orbit, something which has never been done before on a large scale.

When Duffy says “companies like Blue” may get involved, he is not referring to the existing contract, in which Blue Origin will not deliver a ready-to-go lunar lander until the 2030s. Rather he is almost certainly referring to a plan developed by Blue Origin that uses multiple Mk 1 landers, a smaller vehicle originally designed for cargo only. Ars reported on this new lunar architecture three weeks ago, which company engineers have been quietly developing. This plan would not require in-space refueling, and the Mk 1 vehicle is nearing its debut flight early next year.

Duffy also cites “maybe others” getting involved. This refers to a third option. In recent weeks, officials from traditional space companies have been telling Duffy and the chief of staff at the Department of Transportation, Pete Meachum, that they can build an Apollo Lunar Module-like lander within 30 months. Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s associate administrator, favors this government-led approach, sources said.

On Monday, in a statement to Ars, a Lockheed Martin official confirmed that the company was ready if NASA called upon them.

“Throughout this year, Lockheed Martin has been performing significant technical and programmatic analysis for human lunar landers that would provide options to NASA for a safe solution to return humans to the Moon as quickly as possible,” said Bob Behnken, vice president of Exploration and Technology Strategy at Lockheed Martin Space. “We have been working with a cross-industry team of companies and together we are looking forward to addressing Secretary Duffy’s request to meet our country’s lunar objectives.”

NASA would not easily be able to rip up its existing HLS contracts with SpaceX and Blue Origin, as especially with the former much of the funding has already been awarded for milestone payments. Rather, Duffy would likely have to find new funding from Congress. And it would not be cheap. This NASA analysis, from 2017, estimates that a cost-plus, sole-source lunar lander would cost $20 billion to $30 billion, or nearly 10 times what NASA awarded to SpaceX in 2021.

SpaceX founder Elon Musk, responding to Duffy’s comments, seemed to relish the challenge posed by industry competitors.

“SpaceX is moving like lightning compared to the rest of the space industry,” Musk said on the social media site he owns, X. “Moreover, Starship will end up doing the whole Moon mission. Mark my words.”

Duffy’s remarks on television on Monday morning, although significant for the broader space community, also seemed intended for an audience of one—President Trump.</div>

            <div class="field-content">Sandboxing lessens hassle, but fire-and-forget agentic tools still pose risks.

Anthropic has added web and mobile interfaces for Claude Code, its immensely popular command-line interface (CLI) agentic AI coding tool.

The web interface appears to be well-baked at launch, but the mobile version is limited to iOS and is in an earlier stage of development.

The web version of Claude Code can be given access to a GitHub repository. Once that’s done, developers can give it general marching orders like “add real-time inventory tracking to the dashboard.” As with the CLI version, it gets to work, with updates along the way approximating where it’s at and what it’s doing. The web interface supports the recently implemented Claude Code capability to take suggestions or requested changes while it’s in the middle of working on a task. (Previously, if you saw it doing something wrong or missing something, you often had to cancel and start over.)

Developers can run multiple sessions at once and switch between them as needed; they’re listed in a left-side panel in the interface.

Alongside this web and mobile rollout, Anthropic has also introduced a new sandboxing runtime to Claude Code that, along with other things, aims to make the experience both more secure and lower friction.

In the past, Claude Code worked by asking permission before making most changes and steps along the way.

Now, it can instead be given permissions for specific file system folders and network servers. That means fewer approval steps, but it’s also more secure overall against prompt injection and other risks.

According to Anthropic’s engineering blog, the new network isolation approach only allows Internet access “through a unix domain socket connected to a proxy server running outside the sandbox. … This proxy server enforces restrictions on the domains that a process can connect to, and handles user confirmation for newly requested domains.” Additionally, users can customize the proxy to set their own rules for outgoing traffic.

This way, the coding agent can do things like fetch npm packages from approved sources, but without carte blanche for communicating with the outside world, and without badgering the user with constant approvals.

For many developers, these additions are more significant than the availability of web or mobile interfaces. They allow Claude Code agents to operate more independently without as many detailed, line-by-line approvals.

That’s more convenient, but it’s a double-edged sword, as it will also make code review even more important. One of the strengths of the too-many-approvals approach was that it made sure developers were still looking closely at every little change. Now it might be a little bit easier to miss Claude Code making a bad call.

The new features are available in beta now as a research preview, and they are available to Claude users with Pro or Max subscriptions.

            <div class="field-content">Selected testers will have to sign an NDA and use a disguised case.

It took awhile, but Google’s Pixel line of smartphones has established itself as a mainstay of Android after 10 generations. The company has long operated a “Superfans” group to help promote Pixels, but now members have a slim chance to get their hands on Google’s next phones ahead of time. Google is reportedly looking for some lucky Superfans to test and provide feedback on unreleased devices, but they’ll have to promise not to leak anything.

It’s not unheard of for companies to have loyal customers help test new products, but it’s not usually big companies like Google with well-established products like Pixel. Google usually keeps its circle of hardware testers small and limited to employees. According to Bloomberg, Google is running a contest among Superfans to find 15 non-employees suited to test in-development hardware. An official document reviewed by Bloomberg describes the program as a chance to “provide feedback and help shape a Pixel phone currently in development.”

To apply, interested Superfans have to prove they are more super than the rest. They must demonstrate deep knowledge of the Pixel product family and suggest ways the phones can be improved. However, Google is asking this of its biggest supporters—people who still care enough about their smartphones to seek out a group specifically to talk about how much they care about their phones. Is Google going to get gushing praise or constructive criticism?

The Pixel Superfans program has offered freebies and special events in the past, but access to unreleased phones would be the biggest benefit yet. The document explains that those chosen for the program will have to sign a strict non-disclosure agreement and agree to keep the phones in a protective case that disguises its physical appearance at all times.

Pixels are among the most-leaked phones every year. In the past, devices have been photographed straight off the manufacturing line or “fallen off a truck” and ended up for sale months before release. However, it’s unlikely the 15 Superfan testers will lead to more leaks. Like most brands, Google’s pre-release sample phones have physical identifiers to help trace their origin if they end up in a leak or auction listing. The NDA will probably be sufficiently scary to keep the testers in line, as they won’t want to lose their Superfan privileges. Google has also started sharing details on its phones earlier—its Superfan testers may even be involved in these previews.

You can sign up to be a Superfan at any time, but it can take a few weeks to get access after applying. Google has not confirmed when its selection process will begin, but it would have to be soon if Google intends to gather feedback for the Pixel 11. Google’s next phone has probably been in the works for over a year, and it will have to lock down the features at least several months ahead of the expected August 2026 release window. The Pixel 10a is expected to launch even sooner, in spring 2026.
