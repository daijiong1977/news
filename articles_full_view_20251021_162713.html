<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Most U.S. adults are worried about health care becoming more expensive, according to a new AP-NORC poll, as they make decisions about next year&#x27;s health coverage and a government shutdown keeps future health costs in limbo for millions.</p>
<p>About 6 in 10 Americans are &quot;extremely&quot; or &quot;very&quot; concerned about their health costs going up in the next year, the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds - a worry that extends across age groups and includes people with and without health insurance.</p>
<p>Many Americans have other health care anxieties, too. The poll found that about 4 in 10 Americans are &quot;extremely&quot; or &quot;very&quot; concerned about not being able to pay for health care or medications they need, not being able to access health care when they need it, or losing or not having health insurance.</p>
<p>Medicare beneficiaries are already shopping for next year&#x27;s coverage, and open enrollment periods for many other health plans are approaching quickly in November. Federal policies have left millions of people at risk of skyrocketing health insurance premiums or of losing their health insurance altogether. The findings show that many Americans are feeling vulnerable to spiking health care costs, with some expressing concerns about whether they&#x27;ll have coverage at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Even before these health care cuts came into play, I was already having a significant issue getting the care that I needed this year,&quot; she said. &quot;Anything worse than what I already have is pretty scary.&quot;</p>
<p>About 8 in 10 U.S. adults say the issue of health care is &quot;extremely&quot; or &quot;very&quot; important to them personally. That includes about 9 in 10 Democrats and three-quarters of Republicans, and it puts health care next to the economy among Americans&#x27; top issue priorities.</p>
<p>That significant attention on the issue raises the political stakes in what&#x27;s already been a crucial moment for federal health policy in the nation&#x27;s capital.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump&#x27;s mega-bill passed this summer cuts more than $1 trillion from federal health care and food assistance over a decade, largely by imposing work requirements on those receiving aid and by shifting certain federal costs onto the states. Republicans say the cuts will prevent people who don&#x27;t need aid from gaming the system, but the cuts will ultimately result in millions of people losing health insurance coverage, according to projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</p>
<p>More urgently, a congressional deadlock over Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire this year has thrown the federal government into a shutdown that&#x27;s dragged into a fourth straight week with no end in sight. Democratic lawmakers want any funding bill they sign to extend the subsidies, which have made ACA premiums less expensive for millions of people. Republicans in Congress have expressed willingness to negotiate on the issue, but only after the government is reopened.</p>
<p>In interviews, some Americans said they doubted government leaders would take the necessary action to address their concerns on health care.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the federal government&#x27;s job to provide a better way of life for its people,&quot; said Caleb Richter, a 30-year-old certified nursing assistant in Belleville, Wisconsin, who identifies as an independent. &quot;Right now, it just feels like they&#x27;re not trying.&quot;</p>
<p>But the poll reveals a deep ideological divide over what the government&#x27;s role should be, with Democrats far more likely than Republicans to say it&#x27;s the federal government&#x27;s job to make sure all Americans have health coverage. About 8 in 10 Democrats say this, compared with about one-third of Republicans.</p>
<p>Health care continues to be a weakness for Trump. Only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults approve of the Republican president&#x27;s handling of health care, which hasn&#x27;t changed meaningfully since September. Almost all Democrats disapprove of his approach, but so do about 8 in 10 independents and about one-third of Republicans.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Thune predicts trouble for Trump nominee Paul Ingrassia: &amp;#8216;He&amp;rsquo;s not going to pass&amp;#8217;</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump&#x27;s pick to lead an office charged with protecting federal whistleblowers appeared to be in jeopardy on Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he hoped the White House would withdraw the nomination.</p>
<p>The growing opposition to Paul Ingrassia comes after a Politico report of a text chat that showed him saying the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be &quot;tossed into the seventh circle of hell.&quot; Ingrassia also described himself in the chat as having &quot;a Nazi streak&quot; at times.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s not going to pass,&quot; Thune told reporters.</p>
<p>Two Republicans who serve on the committee with jurisdiction over the nomination for the Office of Special Counsel job, Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said they do not support Ingrassia&#x27;s confirmation.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m a no. It never should have got this far,&quot; Johnson said Tuesday. &quot;They ought to pull the nomination.&quot;</p>
<p>Republicans have been able to muscle through the vast majority of Trump&#x27;s nominees in roll call votes despite stiff Democratic opposition. But there have been sporadic instances when Republicans have pushed back, generally behind the scenes, showing there are limits to their support.</p>
<p>Most notably, Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump&#x27;s first choice for attorney general soon after being tabbed for the job. In May, Trump pulled his nomination of Ed Martin Jr. to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation&#x27;s capital, bowing to bipartisan concerns about the conservative activist&#x27;s modest legal experience and support for Jan. 6 rioters. And last month, the White House announced it would be withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni was supposed to succeed a BLS director who was fired following a disappointing jobs report.</p>
<p>According to texts viewed by Politico, Ingrassia told those in the chat that &quot;MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his &#x27;holiday&#x27; should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs.&quot; Politico also spoke to Ingrassia&#x27;s lawyer, who said the text messages might have been manipulated or were missing context. The lawyer did not confirm the texts were authentic.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Ingrassia&#x27;s texts, if authentic, were &quot;foul and disqualifying&quot; He said Trump should pull the nomination of Ingrassia, who works as the White House liaison for Homeland Security.</p>
<p>&quot;He should be fired from his current job within the administration,&quot; Schumer said after reading some of the text messages on the Senate floor. &quot;And he should never hold a position of leadership within the Republican Party or the government ever again.&quot;</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is scheduled to hear from Ingrassia on Thursday. It was unclear if anything on that front has changed with the panel&#x27;s chairman, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., saying &quot;we&#x27;re going to know more on Thursday.&quot;</p>
<p>The Office of Special Counsel is an investigative and prosecutorial office that works to protect government employees and whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. It&#x27;s also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers.</p>
<p>The office, now under the leadership of acting Director Jamieson Greer, confirmed in August that it was investigating former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith on allegations his investigation into Trump constituted political activity. Smith&#x27;s lawyers have said the investigation was &quot;wholly without merit,&quot; based on an &quot;imaginary and unfounded&quot; premise.</p>
<p>In May, Trump described Ingrassia in a social media post as a &quot;highly respected attorney, writer and Constitutional Scholar.&quot;</p>

<p><em>PBS - <a href='https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-marks-hindu-holiday-of-diwali-with-white-house-celebration'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_8a3f716e2972.jpg'></p>
<p>NEW DELHI (AP) - Millions of Indians celebrated Diwali on Monday as lamps illuminated homes and streets across the country to mark the Hindu festival symbolizing the victory of light over darkness.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump will host a Diwali celebration on Tuesday, 4 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above.</p>
<p>Diwali, derived from the word &quot;Deepavali,&quot; meaning &quot;a row of lights,&quot; is typically celebrated by socializing and exchanging gifts. The dates of the festival are based on the Hindu lunar calendar, typically falling in late October or early November.</p>
<p>Shoppers crowded markets to buy flowers, lanterns and candles.</p>
<p>The celebrations were most visible in Ayodhya city in Uttar Pradesh state. Hindus believe the deity Lord Ram was born there and returned after 14 years in exile. People light earthen lamps to mark his homecoming.</p>
<p>As dusk fell Sunday, more than 2.6 million lamps were lit on the banks of the Saryu River in Ayodhya, retaining the Guinness World Record set last year. At least 2,100 Hindu priests performed prayers in unison, their chants echoing across the shimmering riverfront.</p>
<p>The holy city was also decked with fairy lights, and a laser and fireworks show illuminated its lanes and riverbanks. Thousands of residents lit lamps at houses and temples.</p>
<p>Officials said more than 33,000 volunteers helped light the lamps. Nearly 40 families from nearby villages produced 1.6 million lamps. At least 73,000 liters of oil and 5.5 million cotton wicks were used to light the city.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard work lighting diyas (oil lamps) one by one,&quot; said 19-year-old volunteer Rachit Singh, his face glowing in the firelight. &quot;But when you see the whole ghat (stairs to the river) light up, every bit of effort feels worth it.&quot;</p>
<p>In recent years, Diwali celebrations in New Delhi have been clouded by concerns over air pollution, as smoke-emitting firecrackers cause toxic smog that can take days to clear.</p>
<p>On Monday, the level of tiniest particulates surged to 347 on the air quality index in parts of the city - about 14 times the World Health Organization&#x27;s daily recommended maximum exposure - according to SAFAR, the federal government&#x27;s air quality monitoring agency.</p>
<p>Last week, India&#x27;s top court eased a blanket ban on firecrackers in New Delhi during Diwali, allowing limited use of &quot;green firecrackers&quot; that emit fewer pollutants. Developed by federal research institutes, they are designed to cut particulate and gas emissions by about 30%.</p>
<p>The court said they could be used during specific hours from Saturday to Tuesday.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>In Chicago, an immense show of force signals a sharp escalation in Trump immigration crackdown</h2>

<p>CHICAGO (AP) - The music begins low and ominous, with the video showing searchlights skimming along a Chicago apartment building and heavily armed immigration agents storming inside. Guns are drawn. Unmarked cars fill the streets. Agents rappel from a Black Hawk helicopter.</p>
<p>But quickly the soundtrack grows more stirring and the video - edited into a series of dramatic shots and released by the Department of Homeland Security days after the Sept. 30 raid - shows agents leading away shirtless men, their hands zip-tied behind their backs.</p>
<p>Authorities said they were targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, though they also said only two of the 27 immigrants arrested were gang members. They gave few details on the arrests.</p>
<p>But the apartments of dozens of U.S. citizens were targeted, residents said, and at least a half-dozen Americans were held for hours.</p>
<p>The immense show of force signaled a sharp escalation in the White House&#x27;s immigration crackdown and amplified tensions in a city already on edge.</p>
<p>&quot;To every criminal illegal alien: Darkness is no longer your ally,&quot; Homeland Security said in a social media post accompanying the video, which racked up more than 6.4 million views. &quot;We will find you.&quot;</p>
<p>But Tony Wilson, a third-floor resident born and raised on Chicago&#x27;s South Side, sees only horror in what happened.</p>
<p>&quot;It was like we were under attack,&quot; Wilson said days after the raid, speaking through the hole where his door knob used to be. Agents had used a grinder to cut out the deadbolt, and he still couldn&#x27;t close the door properly, let alone lock it. So he had barricaded himself inside, blocking the door with furniture.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t even hear them knock or nothing,&quot; said Wilson, a 58-year-old U.S. citizen on disability.</p>
<p>The raid was executed in the heart of South Shore, an overwhelmingly Black neighborhood on Lake Michigan that has long been a tangle of middle-class dreams, urban decay and gentrification.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a place where teams of drug dealers troll for customers outside ornate lakeside apartment buildings. It has some of the city&#x27;s best vegan restaurants but also takeout places where the catfish fillets are ordered through bullet-proof glass.</p>
<p>It has well-paid professors from the University of Chicago but is also where one-third of households scrape by on less than $25,000 a year.</p>
<p>The apartment building where the raid occurred has long been troubled. Five stories tall and built in the 1950s, residents said it was often strewn with garbage, the elevators rarely worked and crime was a constant worry. Things had grown more chaotic after dozens of Venezuelan migrants arrived in the past few years, residents said. While no residents said they felt threatened by the migrants, many described a rise in noise and hallway trash.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House on Monday started tearing down part of the East Wing, the traditional base of operations for the first lady, to build President Donald Trump&#x27;s $250 million ballroom despite lacking approval for construction from the federal agency that oversees such projects.</p>
<p>Dramatic photos of the demolition work showed construction equipment tearing into the East Wing façade and windows and other building parts in tatters on the ground. Some reporters watched from a park near the Treasury Department, which is next to the East Wing.</p>
<p>Trump announced the start of construction in a social media post and referenced the work while hosting 2025 college baseball champs Louisiana State University and LSU-Shreveport in the East Room. He noted the work was happening &quot;right behind us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;It just started today.&quot;</p>
<p>The White House has moved ahead with the massive construction project despite not yet having sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, which approves construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area.</p>
<p>Its chairman, Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary and one of Trump&#x27;s top aides, said at the commission&#x27;s September meeting that agency does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property.</p>

<p>&quot;What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build,&quot; Scharf said last month.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the White House had submitted the ballroom plans for the agency&#x27;s review and approval. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and the commission&#x27;s offices are closed because of the government shutdown.</p>
<p>The Republican president had said in July when the project was announced that the ballroom would not interfere with the mansion itself.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;ll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I&#x27;m the biggest fan of,&quot; he said of the White House.</p>

<p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance arrived in Israel on Tuesday to shore up the fragile U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, following a burst of deadly violence and questions over the plan for long-term peace.</p>
<p>Watch Vance speak in the player above.</p>
<p>Vance was meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials and is expected to stay in the region until Thursday. White House envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump&#x27;s son-in-law, arrived Monday and Vance met with them upon landing.</p>
<p>Vance was also expected to meet with families of hostages whose remains are still in Gaza and some of the living hostages released last week. Witkoff and Kushner met with nine of them on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hamas said it has recovered the remains of two more hostages and planned to hand them over Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The ceasefire took effect on Oct. 10. While it has been tested by Sunday&#x27;s fighting and mutual accusations of violations, both Israel and Hamas have said they are committed to the deal. Trump has made clear he wants it to succeed.</p>
<p>The meetings highlight the urgency of launching negotiations for the second phase of the U.S. plan, which must address issues such as the disarmament of Hamas and the governance of postwar Gaza. Hamas negotiators reiterated that the group is committed to ensuring the war &quot;ends once and for all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From the day we signed the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, we were determined and committed to seeing it through to the end,&quot; Hamas chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, who is in Cairo, told Egypt&#x27;s Al-Qahera News television late Monday.</p>
<p>Israel confirmed that Palestinian militants had released the body of Tal Haimi, who was killed in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. He was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. The 42-year-old was part of its emergency response team and had four children, including one born after the attack.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the ceasefire, Israel is waiting for Hamas to turn over the remains of 15 hostages. Thirteen others have been turned over.</p>
<p>Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Israel is releasing 15 Palestinian bodies for the remains of each dead hostage, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government. It said Israel had transferred another 15 on Tuesday, for a total of 165 since earlier this month.</p>
<p>International organizations said they were scaling up humanitarian aid entering Gaza, while Hamas-led security forces launched a crackdown against what it called price gouging by private merchants.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday - not for urgent talks on how to end it but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.</p>
<p>Watch the Senate in the player above.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.</p>
<p>With both sides showing no signs of movement, it&#x27;s unclear how long the stalemate will last - even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the lunch meeting in the White House Rose Garden appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.</p>
<p>Asked about the message at lunch, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, second in Senate GOP leadership, told Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; on Tuesday that it will be, &quot;Republicans are united, and I expect the president to say, &#x27;Stand strong.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Senate Republican leader John Thune, of South Dakota said on Monday that he thinks Trump is ready to &quot;get involved on having the discussion&quot; about extending the subsidies. &quot;But I don&#x27;t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening.</p>
<p>Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.</p>
<p>And as the shutdown keeps future health costs in limbo for millions of Americans, most U.S. adults are worried about health care becoming more expensive, according to a new Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, as they make decisions about next year&#x27;s health coverage.</p>
<p>Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position remains the same: We want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,&quot; said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.</p>
<p>Schumer called the White House meeting a &quot;pep rally&quot; and said it was &quot;shameful&quot; that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.</p>
<p>Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.</p>
<p>Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn&#x27;t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, &quot;if not something on a much longer-term basis.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>U.S. appeals court says Trump can take command of Oregon National Guard troops, though deployment blocked for now</h2>
<p><em>PBS - <a href='https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/u-s-appeals-court-says-trump-can-take-command-of-oregon-national-guard-troops-though-deployment-blocked-for-now'>original</a></em></p>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - An appeals court on Monday put on hold a lower-court ruling that kept President Donald Trump from taking command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. However, Trump is still barred from actually deploying those troops, at least for now.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders early this month - one that prohibited Trump from calling up the troops so he could send them to Portland, and another that prohibited him from sending any National Guard members to Oregon at all, after the president tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.</p>
<p>The Justice Department appealed the first order, and in a 2-1 ruling Monday, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the administration. The majority said the president was likely to succeed on his claim that he had the authority to federalize the troops based on a determination he was unable to enforce the laws without them.</p>
<p>However, Immergut&#x27;s second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed.</p>
<p>Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.</p>
<p>The administration has said that because the legal reasoning underpinning both temporary restraining orders was the same, the second one was also invalid, and the majority opinion also said the two TROs &quot;rise or fall together.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon after the ruling Monday, the Justice Department asked Immergut to immediately dissolve her second order, which would allow Trump to deploy troops to Portland. The Justice Department argued that it is not the role of the courts to second-guess the president&#x27;s determination about when to deploy troops.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision staying the first TRO is a significant change in law that plainly warrants dissolution of this Court&#x27;s second TRO,&quot; the administration&#x27;s lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat, said he would ask for a broader panel of the appeals to reconsider the decision.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#x27;s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,&quot; Rayfield said. &quot;We are on a dangerous path in America.&quot;</p>
<p>The Justice Department did not return an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>Trump&#x27;s efforts to deploy National Guard troops in Democratic-led cities have been mired in legal challenges. A judge in California ruled that his deployment of thousands of National Guard troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a longstanding law that generally prohibits the use of the military for civilian policing, and the administration on Friday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>Mostly small nightly protests, limited to a single block, have been occurring since June outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland. Larger crowds, including counterprotesters and live-streamers, have shown up at times, and federal agents have used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday - not for urgent talks on how to end it but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.</p>
<p>With both sides showing no signs of movement, it&#x27;s unclear how long the stalemate will last - even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the lunch meeting in the White House Rose Garden appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.</p>
<p>Asked about the message at lunch, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, second in Senate GOP leadership, told Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; on Tuesday that it will be, &quot;Republicans are united, and I expect the president to say, &#x27;Stand strong.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Senate Republican leader John Thune, of South Dakota said on Monday that he thinks Trump is ready to &quot;get involved on having the discussion&quot; about extending the subsidies. &quot;But I don&#x27;t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening.</p>
<p>Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.</p>
<p>Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.</p>
<p>And as the shutdown keeps future health costs in limbo for millions of Americans, most U.S. adults are worried about health care becoming more expensive, according to a new Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, as they make decisions about next year&#x27;s health coverage.</p>
<p>Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position remains the same: We want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,&quot; said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.</p>
<p>Schumer called the White House meeting a &quot;pep rally&quot; and said it was &quot;shameful&quot; that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.</p>
<p>Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.</p>
<p>Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn&#x27;t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, &quot;if not something on a much longer-term basis.&quot;</p>

<p><em>PBS - <a href='https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-gop-led-redistricting-efforts-may-disenfranchise-black-voters'>original</a></em></p>

<p>Republicans in North Carolina moved forward with a plan to redraw the state&#x27;s congressional map and eliminate its only swing district. It&#x27;s part of a GOP push to maintain control of Congress through maps that have the effect of diluting Black political power and diminishing the voting strength of communities of color. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers in North Carolina moved forward with a proposal today to redraw their state&#x27;s congressional map in a way that would eliminate its only swing district.</p>
<p>The mid-decade redistricting is part of a nationwide push by President Trump and his Republican allies to help the GOP maintain control of Congress in next year&#x27;s elections, often through maps that have the effect of diluting Black political power and diminishing the voting strength of communities of color.</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court appeared willing to issue a ruling that could further that effort during arguments in a Louisiana redistricting case.</p>
<p>NAACP Legal Defense Fund president Janai Nelson argued the case before the court in defense of Louisiana voters, and she joins us now.</p>
<p>Janai Nelson, President and Director-Counsel, NAACP Legal Defense Fund: Thank you. Happy to be here.</p>
<p>So what was the main argument you presented before the court in defense of the existing Louisiana map that includes two majority-Black districts? What did you want the justices to understand about the stakes?</p>
<p>Well, I wanted the justices to understand that that map was remedying very flagrant violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and that, if for some reason, that map was not acceptable to them, that the proper recourse is to send it back to the lower courts, so that another map could be drawn that does remedy the racial discrimination that we proved in the case, and that what the court should not do is tinker with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, because it has been such a formidable protection and tool to advance our democracy.</p>
<p>And you just explained the many ways in which Black voters are often exploited or their votes are diluted for a variety of reasons, including sometimes partisan aims. And the Voting Rights Act, Section 2 in particular, is the only shield from that we can use with any expectation of real protection.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, what is Section 2 and what does it do?</p>
<p>So, Section 2 is part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It&#x27;s a permanent provision of that act. And it basically says that there&#x27;s no voting practice, procedure, qualification, anything having to do with voting that can abridge the right to vote, so deny it or dilute it or harm it in any way, minimize it, on account of race.</p>
<p>And, as we mentioned, North Carolina Republicans are moving forward with this plan to effectively oust one of the state&#x27;s three Black members of Congress by carving up an area of Eastern North Carolina in this congressional map, and this district happens to have a large Black population.</p>
<p>So how does that square with what constitutes racial dilution under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act?</p>
<p>Well, it&#x27;s pretty squarely a violation of the act, as far as I can tell. It is using Black voters as a means for gaining political power or partisan control.</p>
<p>And while the Supreme Court did say in another case, Rucho v. Common Cause, that it will not entertain any partisan gerrymandering claims, racial gerrymandering is still unlawful and it&#x27;s still justiciable by the court, meaning that those claims are still viable before the court.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Scientists discover how a high-fat keto diet could keep your brain young</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083646.htm'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_bda8fee51b5a.webp'></p>
<p>Protecting your brain&#x27;s energy and keeping your mind sharp might start with what&#x27;s on your plate. Foods such as fish and seafood, meat, non-starchy vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, eggs, and even full-fat dairy may play a key role in maintaining cognitive health.</p>
<p>Exploring the Power of the Ketogenic Diet</p>
<p>At the University of Missouri, researchers are exploring how these foods influence brain function. Their work focuses on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan known as the ketogenic diet. Early results suggest that this approach could not only support long-term brain health but also slow or even prevent cognitive decline, especially among individuals who face a higher genetic risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</p>
<p>Inside the Roy Blunt NextGen Precision Health building, Ai-Ling Lin, a professor in the School of Medicine, and doctoral student Kira Ivanich are examining how the ketogenic diet may benefit people with the APOE4 gene, which is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</p>
<p>In their recent study using mice, Lin and Ivanich found that females with the APOE4 gene developed healthier gut bacteria and showed higher brain energy levels when following a ketogenic diet compared to those on a high-carbohydrate diet. Males did not show the same improvement, suggesting that gender may influence who benefits most from this dietary approach.</p>
<p>The key lies in how the brain produces its energy.</p>
<p>&quot;When we eat carbs, our brains convert the glucose into fuel for our brains, but those with the APOE4 gene -- particularly females -- struggle to convert the glucose into brain energy, and this can lead to cognitive decline down the road,&quot; Ivanich said. &quot;By switching to a keto diet, ketones are produced and used as an alternative fuel source. This may decrease the chance of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s by preserving the health of brain cells.&quot;</p>
<p>These findings highlight the potential of &quot;precision nutrition,&quot; an approach that adapts diets and interventions to fit a person&#x27;s unique biology.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of expecting one solution to work for everyone, it might be better to consider a variety of factors, including someone&#x27;s genotype, gut microbiome, gender and age,&quot; Lin said. &quot;Since the symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s -- which tend to be irreversible once they start -- usually appear after age 65, the time to be thinking about preserving brain health is well before then, so hopefully our research can offer hope to many people through early interventions.&quot;</p>
<p>Advancing Research Through Collaboration</p>
<p>Lin joined Mizzou in part for its collaborative environment and advanced imaging facilities located in the NextGen Precision Health building and at the University of Missouri Research Reactor.</p>
<p>&quot;We can do a lot of things in-house here that at other places we would have to outsource,&quot; Lin said. &quot;This is team science. The impact we make will be much better when we work together than by ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>With cutting-edge imaging equipment and both research and clinical spaces under the same roof, the NextGen Precision Health building allows Mizzou to move quickly from preclinical models to human trials.</p>
<p>For Ivanich, that real-world impact is personal.</p>
<p>&quot;When my grandmother got Alzheimer&#x27;s, that sparked my interest in this topic, so being able to make an impact to help people preserve their brain health is very rewarding,&quot; she said. &quot;With Mizzou being a leading research university and having a tight-knit community feel, I know I&#x27;m at the right place.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>This simple innovation could change blood pressure testing forever</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083644.htm'>original</a></em></p>

<p>A newly developed method that improves the accuracy of ankle blood pressure measurements could transform care for people who are unable to have their blood pressure taken from the arm.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Exeter Medical School, in a study published in BMJ Open and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), analyzed data from more than 33,000 individuals to create a personalized predictive model. This model enables healthcare professionals to estimate arm blood pressure more precisely using ankle readings (when compared with earlier approaches). To make the process easier to use, the team has also launched an online calculator that helps both clinicians and patients interpret ankle-based results.</p>
<p>Why Accuracy in Blood Pressure Measurement Matters</p>
<p>More than one billion people worldwide live with high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. Reliable measurements are crucial for diagnosing and managing the condition effectively.</p>
<p>Although blood pressure is typically measured on the upper arm, some people cannot have it taken there due to disability, limb loss, or conditions such as stroke. In such cases, readings are taken from the ankle. However, ankle measurements are usually higher than arm readings, and because treatment guidelines are based on arm data, this difference can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate treatment decisions.</p>
<p>Improving Accuracy and Reducing Misdiagnoses</p>
<p>Professor Chris Clark, who led the research, explained: &quot;Our new method will give a more accurate blood pressure reading for around two percent more people. This doesn&#x27;t sound a big number but remember, around a third of adults have high blood pressure and once you get into your 60s it&#x27;s more than half of the adults. The NHS Health Check Programme diagnoses 38,000 new cases annually in England alone, so two percent equates to 750 fewer potential misdiagnoses per year in England, and tens of thousands globally.&quot;</p>
<p>To achieve this, the researchers used statistical modeling on data from 33,710 people (mean age 58 years, 45 per cent female) across multiple countries. The analysis explored the relationship between arm and ankle blood pressures, developed a predictive equation for estimating arm values from ankle readings, and examined how ankle readings relate to important health outcomes (such as heart attack risk).</p>
<p>This advancement could help close a significant health gap by providing accurate and personalized blood pressure results for people who have been excluded from standard monitoring. It is estimated that up to 10,000 adults in the UK live with upper limb loss, while 75 per cent of the country&#x27;s 1.3 million stroke survivors experience upper limb difficulties that can make arm-based measurements challenging or impossible.</p>
<p>The project received support from the Stroke Association and the Thalidomide Trust, two organizations advocating for people affected by these conditions.</p>
<p>Expert Reactions and Public Health Impact</p>
<p>Juliet Bouverie OBE, CEO of the Stroke Association, said: &quot;Someone in the UK has a stroke every five minutes, with high blood pressure accounting for around half of those. Around two-thirds of stroke survivors will leave hospital with some form of disability, including paralysis in an arm, which can prevent getting accurate blood pressure readings from the affected limb. Many stroke survivors feel anxious about having another stroke, so receiving an accurate blood pressure reading in the ankle will not only provide benefits in the primary prevention of stroke, but importantly in easing the minds of stroke survivors who are already dealing with the devastating impact of stroke.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Kevin Munro, Director of NIHR&#x27;s Research for Patient Benefit Programme, said: &quot;This research has identified an ingenious solution to an important problem -- finding a way to measure blood pressure for people who cannot have it monitored via the upper arm. Keeping track of blood pressure is a vital tool to help keep people healthy and this NIHR-funded research will help to spot high blood pressure and treat it even more widely.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Scientists stumble on a hidden quantum trick in 2D materials</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083640.htm'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_4dec8bd33015.webp'></p>
<p>When arranged in just the right ways, two-dimensional materials can display unusual and valuable quantum effects such as superconductivity and exotic types of magnetism. Understanding why these effects arise, and how to control them, remains one of the biggest challenges for physicists and engineers. A new study published in Nature Physics has uncovered a previously unseen property that may explain how these mysterious quantum phases form and evolve.</p>
<p>Using a novel terahertz (THz) spectroscopy method, researchers found that thin stacks of 2D materials -- commonly used in laboratories worldwide -- can naturally create what are called cavities. These tiny spaces confine both light and electrons into even smaller regions, significantly altering their interactions and behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve uncovered a hidden layer of control in quantum materials and opened a path to shaping light-matter interactions in ways that could help us both understand exotic phases of matter and ultimately harness them for future quantum technologies,&quot; said James McIver, assistant professor of physics at Columbia and lead author of the paper.</p>
<p>The work traces its origins to Hamburg, where McIver led a research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD). The institute is part of the Max Planck-New York Center on Nonequilibrium Quantum Phenomena, a collaboration among MPSD, Columbia, the Flatiron Institute, and Cornell University. Researchers at the Center study how stable physical systems respond when pushed away from equilibrium.</p>
<p>McIver&#x27;s team explores these questions through light. &quot;2D materials, with their fascinating macroscopic properties, often behave like black boxes. By shining light on them, we can literally shed light on the hidden behavior of their electrons, revealing details that would otherwise remain unseen,&quot; said Gunda Kipp, a PhD student at MPSD and first author of the paper. One obstacle, however, is that the wavelengths of light needed to probe 2D materials are far larger than the materials themselves, which are thinner than a human hair.</p>
<p>To overcome this scale mismatch, the researchers developed a chip-sized spectroscope that compresses THz light -- the range where many quantum effects occur -- from about 1 millimeter down to just 3 micrometers. This compact design made it possible to directly observe how electrons move within 2D materials. They first tested their approach using graphene, a well-known form of carbon, to measure its optical conductivity.</p>
<p>What they found was unexpected: distinct standing waves.</p>
<p>&quot;Light can couple to electrons to form hybrid light-matter quasiparticles. These quasiparticles move as waves and, under certain conditions, they can become confined, much like the standing wave on a guitar string that produces a distinct note,&quot; explained MPSD postdoctoral fellow and co-first-author Hope Bretscher.</p>
<p>In a guitar, the string&#x27;s fixed ends define where the wave can form. Pressing a finger on the string shortens the wave, changing the pitch of the note. In optics, a similar process occurs when two mirrors trap light between them, creating a standing wave inside what scientists call a cavity. When a material is placed inside that cavity, the trapped light can repeatedly interact with it, altering its electronic properties.</p>
<p>However, the researchers discovered that mirrors might not even be necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;We found that the material&#x27;s own edges already act as mirrors,&quot; said Kipp. With their THz spectroscope, they observed that excited streams of electrons reflect off the edges to form a type of hybrid light-matter quasiparticle called a plasmon polariton.</p>
<p>The McIver lab studied a device made up of multiple layers, each of which can act as a cavity separated by a few tens of nanometers. The plasmons that form in each layer can, in turn, interact -- often strongly. &quot;It&#x27;s like connecting two guitar strings; once linked, the note changes,&quot; said Bretscher. &quot;In our case, it changes drastically.&quot;</p>
<p>The next step was to understand what determines the frequencies of these quasiparticles and how tightly light and matter couple together. &quot;With co-author and MPSD postdoctoral fellow Marios Michael, we developed an analytical theory that only needed a handful of geometric sample parameters to match the observations of our experiments,&quot; said Kipp. &quot;With just a click of a button, our theory can extract the properties of a material and will help us design and tailor future samples to obtain specific properties. For example, by tracking resonances as functions of carrier density, temperature, or magnetic field, we may uncover the mechanisms driving different quantum phases.&quot;</p>
<p>While this study focused on plasmons, the new chip-scale THz spectroscope could detect other types of quasiparticles oscillating in many different 2D materials. The team is already testing new samples in both Hamburg and New York.</p>
<p>&quot;This whole project was a bit of a serendipitous discovery. We didn&#x27;t expect to see</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Physicists discover strange spinning crystals that behave like living matter</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083635.htm'>original</a></em></p>

<p>It may sound unbelievable, but crystals made of rotating particles are real. A group of physicists from Aachen, Düsseldorf, Mainz, and Wayne State University (Detroit, USA) has explored these unusual materials and their remarkable behavior. These crystals can easily split into separate fragments, form unusual grain boundaries, and display controllable structural defects. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the researchers present a broad theoretical framework that can predict several new properties of these so-called &quot;transverse interaction&quot; systems.</p>
<p>Rotating Systems in Nature and Technology</p>
<p>&quot;Transverse forces&quot; can appear not only in engineered materials, such as certain magnetic solids, but also in biological systems. In an experiment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), researchers observed that groups of starfish embryos, through their swimming motions, influenced each other&#x27;s movement in a way that caused them to rotate around one another. The biological function of this coordinated motion remains unclear, but it shares the same fundamental feature found in these synthetic systems: interacting, rotating objects.</p>
<p>Professor Dr. Hartmut Löwen from the Institute of Theoretical Physics II at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (HHU) explains: &quot;A system of many rotating constituent elements exhibits a qualitatively new behavior that is non-intuitive: At high concentrations, these objects form a solid body of rotors, which possess &#x27;odd&#x27; material properties.&quot;</p>
<p>One such property is known as &quot;odd elasticity.&quot; Normally, when a material is pulled, it stretches along the direction of the force. In contrast, an odd elastic material does not stretch -- it twists instead.</p>
<p>Twisting, Breaking, and Reforming</p>
<p>This kind of &quot;odd&quot; solid can even disintegrate on its own. When the rotating building blocks rub together strongly enough, the solid can fragment into many smaller spinning crystallites. Even more surprisingly, these fragments can later reassemble themselves into a coherent structure once again.</p>
<p>A research team led by Professor Dr. Zhi-Feng Huang from Wayne State University and Professor Löwen developed a multiscale theoretical model to describe the behavior of these odd crystals. Using this model, they performed simulations that revealed unexpected patterns and possible technological uses for these rotating materials.</p>
<p>Reversing the Rules of Crystal Growth</p>
<p>The team found that large crystals governed by transverse interactions tend to break down into smaller spinning units, while smaller crystals grow until reaching a specific critical size. This outcome runs counter to conventional crystal growth, where materials typically expand steadily under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>Professor Huang explains:&quot;We have discovered a fundamental property of nature underlying this process which determines the relation between the size of the critical fragments and their rotation speed.&quot;</p>
<p>Study co-author Professor Dr. Raphael Wittkowski of the DWI -- Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials and of RWTH Aachen University, adds: &quot;We furthermore demonstrated how defects in the crystals exhibit dynamics of their own. The formation of such defects can be influenced from outside, which allows properties of the crystals to be specifically controlled with a view to usage applications.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our far-reaching theory encompasses all systems evidencing such transverse interactions. Conceivable applications range from colloid research to biology,&quot; declares co-author Dr. Michael te Vrugt, Assistant Professor at the University of Mainz.</p>
<p>Professor Löwen adds: &quot;The model calculations indicate concrete application potential. The novel elastic properties of these new crystals could be exploited to invent new technical switching elements, for example.&quot;</p>
<p>In physics, interactions such as gravity and the Coulomb force are known as central forces because they act along the line connecting the centers of two bodies. These forces cause objects to move toward or away from each other.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Brain fog during menopause? Here’s what’s really going on</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083633.htm'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_b89c7988510e.webp'></p>
<p>Many women going through menopause report experiencing what they describe as &quot;brain fog,&quot; a mix of forgetfulness, reduced focus, and mental fatigue. These symptoms are thought to stem in part from hormonal fluctuations that occur during this transition. To better understand the connection, researchers conducted a review of existing studies examining how menopause affects brain structure and its links to cognitive, emotional, and physical health. The findings from this review will be presented at the 2025 Annual Meeting of The Menopause Society, scheduled for October 21-25 in Orlando.</p>
<p>How Menopause Alters Brain Structure</p>
<p>Research has shown that menopause is accompanied by measurable structural changes in the brain. Several studies have identified decreases in gray matter volume in key regions such as the frontal and temporal cortices and the hippocampus, which play major roles in memory and decision-making. These reductions have been associated with declines in certain types of memory performance, including verbal and visuospatial abilities.</p>
<p>Other research has found that white matter hyperintensities -- bright spots visible on MRI scans that often indicate tissue damage -- are more common during menopause, particularly in women who experience early menopause or frequent hot flashes. These changes may result from reduced blood flow to the brain&#x27;s white matter. The lesions are linked to a higher risk of neurological symptoms such as cognitive decline, balance problems, mood changes, and an increased likelihood of stroke and dementia.</p>
<p>Evidence of Brain Recovery and Hormonal Adaptation</p>
<p>Interestingly, some findings suggest that gray matter volume may partially recover after menopause, hinting at the brain&#x27;s ability to adapt through neuroplasticity. Scientists have also observed higher estrogen receptor density during the menopause transition, which may reflect the brain&#x27;s attempt to compensate for falling hormone levels. However, this increase has also been tied to weaker memory performance in some cases. Changes in blood vessel reactivity and energy metabolism within the brain further illustrate how menopause affects neural health and resilience.</p>
<p>Some evidence suggests a partial recovery of gray matter volume postmenopause, potentially reflecting compensatory neuroplastic processes. Additionally, elevated estrogen receptor density during the menopause transition may represent an adaptive response to declining hormone levels, although it has also been associated with poorer memory outcomes Alterations in cerebrovascular reactivity and brain energy metabolism further underscore the impact of menopause on neural integrity and functional resilience.</p>
<p>As part of a project carried out at the BRAVE Lab of the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at Ponce Health Sciences University (Puerto Rico), PhD-PSY students Angélica Rodríguez and Andrea Pereira conducted a bibliographical review under the supervision of Dr. Bárbara Barros and Dr. Karla Martínez. Their work analyzed relevant scientific literature on menopause-related brain structural changes and how these alterations may contribute to menopause symptoms. More detailed results will be discussed at the 2025 Annual Meeting of The Menopause Society as part of the poster presentation entitled &quot;Menopause and Brain Structural Changes: A bibliographic revision.&quot; Rodríguez, first author, will be presenting the poster at the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;This type of work highlights the need to continue exploring the relationship between the brain and menopause, particularly their connection with the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms women experience during this stage,&quot; says Angélica Rodríguez, PhD student in Psychology at Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Building Toward Better Understanding and Treatment</p>
<p>&quot;This study represents the cumulative body of scientific knowledge relative to structural changes that take place in the brain during menopause,&quot; says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, medical director for The Menopause Society. &quot;These data will hopefully lead to a better understanding of the factors underlying some of the cognitive concerns experienced by women during the menopause transition so that we can ultimately identify effective therapies.&quot;</p>

<p>An idea once dismissed as science fiction -- cooling Earth by scattering sunlight-reflecting particles into the upper atmosphere -- is now being taken seriously by researchers. This proposed technique, called stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), aims to offset global warming by mimicking the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions. Hundreds of scientific models have explored how it might work. Yet researchers at Columbia University caution that those models overlook how complex, uncertain, and potentially risky such an effort would be.</p>
<p>&quot;Even when simulations of SAI in climate models are sophisticated, they&#x27;re necessarily going to be idealized. Researchers model the perfect particles that are the perfect size. And in the simulation, they put exactly how much of them they want, where they want them. But when you start to consider where we actually are, compared to that idealized situation, it reveals a lot of the uncertainty in those predictions,&quot; says V. Faye McNeill, an atmospheric chemist and aerosol scientist at Columbia&#x27;s Climate School and Columbia Engineering.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a range of things that might happen if you try to do this -- and we&#x27;re arguing that the range of possible outcomes is a lot wider than anybody has appreciated until now.&quot;</p>

<p>In a study published in Scientific Reports, McNeill and her team examined the physical, political, and economic barriers that make SAI far more complicated in reality than in theory. They reviewed existing studies to understand how the results of SAI would depend on the details of how and where it is deployed. Key factors include the altitude and latitude of particle release, the time of year, and the total amount of material injected into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Among these variables, latitude appears to have the greatest influence. SAI efforts concentrated near the poles, for example, could disrupt tropical monsoons, while releases near the equator might alter jet streams and interfere with global air circulation.</p>
<p>&quot;It isn&#x27;t just a matter of getting five teragrams of sulfur into the atmosphere. It matters where and when you do it,&quot; says McNeill. These variabilities suggest that, if SAI takes place, it should be done in a centralized, coordinated fashion. Given geopolitical realities, however, the researchers say that is unlikely.</p>
<p>Most climate models studying SAI assume the use of sulfate aerosols, similar to the compounds produced by volcanic eruptions. When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, for instance, global temperatures dropped by nearly one degree Celsius for several years. That event is often cited as evidence that SAI could temporarily cool the planet.</p>
<p>But volcanic activity also highlights the risks. Pinatubo&#x27;s eruption disrupted the Indian monsoon system, reduced rainfall across South Asia, and contributed to ozone depletion. Similar side effects could result from artificial sulfate releases, including acid rain and soil contamination. These concerns have pushed scientists to investigate other, potentially safer materials.</p>
<p>Searching for Better Materials</p>
<p>Proposed alternatives include minerals such as calcium carbonate, alpha alumina, rutile and anatase titania, cubic zirconia, and even diamond. While much attention has been paid to how well these materials might scatter sunlight, other essential questions -- such as their availability and practicality -- have been less explored.</p>
<p>&quot;Scientists have discussed the use of aerosol candidates with little consideration of how practical limitations might limit your ability to actually inject massive amounts of them yearly,&quot; says Miranda Hack, an aerosol scientist at Columbia University and the new paper&#x27;s lead author. &quot;A lot of the materials that have been proposed are not particularly abundant.&quot;</p>
<p>Diamond, for instance, would perform well optically but is far too scarce and expensive to use. Cubic zirconia and rutile titania could meet demand in theory, but economic modeling by the Columbia team suggests production costs would skyrocket with increased demand. Only calcium carbonate and alpha alumina are abundant enough to be feasible at scale, yet both face serious technical problems during dispersion.</p>
<p>For SAI to work, particles must remain extremely small -- less than one micron in size. However, the mineral alternatives tend to clump together into larger aggregates. These larger clusters scatter sunlight less effectively and behave unpredictably in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of having these perfect optical properties, you have something much worse. In comparison to sulfate, I don&#x27;t think we would necessarily see the types of climate benefits that have been discussed,&quot; says Hack.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>How just minutes of running can supercharge your health</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092848.htm'>original</a></em></p>

<p>That&#x27;s where interval running comes in. It promises nearly all the same benefits of regular running, but in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>Interval running is based on the principles of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), a workout style that alternates short bursts of intense effort with brief recovery periods. Although HIIT has existed for nearly a century, it became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s through training methods like Tabata (20 seconds of intense movement followed by ten seconds of rest) and CrossFit (a demanding combination of cardio, gymnastics, and weightlifting).</p>
<p>In a typical HIIT workout, you might do 30 seconds of burpees at full effort, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat the sequence several times. The alternating pattern challenges the body to adapt and recover quickly, leading to major fitness improvements in less time.</p>
<p>This same approach can easily be applied to running for those who want to see results faster without spending hours on the road.</p>
<p>How to Apply HIIT Principles to Running</p>
<p>One simple example is the &quot;10-20-30 method.&quot; This routine involves 30 seconds of walking or slow jogging, 20 seconds of running at a moderate pace, and a final 10 seconds of all-out sprinting.</p>
<p>Another option is the &quot;fartlek&quot; method (Swedish for &quot;speed play&quot;), which adds short sprints at random intervals during a jog. Instead of maintaining a steady pace, you mix in bursts of speed throughout your run, keeping things dynamic and fun.</p>
<p>The Science-Backed Benefits of Interval Running</p>
<p>Research consistently shows that HIIT-style running provides significant health improvements for the heart, metabolism, and body composition (how much fat the body stores and where it&#x27;s located).</p>
<p>In studies involving overweight or obese participants, sprint intervals led to greater gains in cardiovascular fitness than steady-paced runs. Those who sprinted showed higher improvements in their V̇O₂ max -- the measure of how much oxygen the body can use during intense activity.</p>
<p>Even people who already run regularly can benefit. In one 12-week study, runners who added HIIT sessions to their endurance training saw greater improvements in V̇O₂ peak, another key measure of cardiovascular performance. Higher V̇O₂ values are linked not only to better athletic ability but also to a lower risk of premature death.</p>
<p>Improved Metabolism and Fat-Burning Power</p>
<p>Studies also show that alternating bursts of running and walking can improve metabolic health more effectively than continuous exercise. Specifically, interval training enhances blood glucose control, which helps reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Workouts like the 10-20-30 method also stimulate the mitochondria, the energy-producing parts of cells, more than steady exercise does. This leads to improved stamina, better blood pressure, and healthier cholesterol levels. It even helps lower &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol while reducing overall cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p>Both continuous and interval running can decrease visceral fat (the harmful fat stored around organs), but HIIT accomplishes it in less time. Just 18 minutes of sprint intervals, three times a week, can lead to noticeable health benefits.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>This simple neck measurement might reveal hidden heart risks</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092844.htm'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_195012e8544a.webp'></p>
<p>For decades, doctors have depended on indicators such as body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio to gauge a person&#x27;s risk for chronic disease. But researchers are now turning their attention to a different, often-overlooked measurement: neck circumference.</p>
<p>While a thick neck may suggest physical power, like that of athletes in contact sports, research indicates it could also be a marker of hidden health risks.</p>
<p>BMI calculates body fat by comparing weight to height, but it doesn&#x27;t always paint an accurate picture. A muscular athlete may register a high BMI without carrying excess fat. This is where measuring neck size can offer additional clues about what&#x27;s happening inside the body.</p>
<p>Studies have found that individuals with larger necks relative to their body size are more likely to develop serious health issues. The reason lies in fat distribution -- particularly in the upper body.</p>
<p>Fat stored around the upper torso releases fatty acids into the bloodstream, which can interfere with how the body regulates cholesterol, blood sugar, and heart rhythm. In effect, neck circumference acts as a visible indicator of visceral fat, the harmful kind that accumulates around internal organs.</p>
<p>The Link to Heart Disease and Other Conditions</p>
<p>Evidence connecting neck size to health outcomes is compelling. People with thicker necks show higher rates of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.</p>
<p>Atrial fibrillation is of particular concern because it causes irregular heartbeats and erratic blood flow, raising the risk of blood clots and stroke. Over time, this irregular rhythm can strain the heart and lead to failure.</p>
<p>Neck circumference is also tied to coronary heart disease, where narrowed arteries reduce the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart.</p>
<p>The risks don&#x27;t stop at cardiovascular problems. Larger neck size is associated with a greater likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, both of which can lead to long-term complications such as nerve damage, vision loss, and limb amputation.</p>
<p>Sleep disorders are another major concern. A thicker neck is a known risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. This not only leads to severe daytime fatigue but also places additional stress on the heart and blood vessels. People with sleep apnea are also more prone to accidents caused by exhaustion.</p>
<p>When Neck Size Becomes a Warning</p>
<p>So, how big is too big? Research suggests that men with a neck circumference of 17 inches (43 cm) or more, and women with 14 inches (35.5 cm) or more, face elevated health risks.</p>
<p>Perhaps most surprising, these dangers are not limited to people who are overweight. Even individuals with a normal BMI may be at risk if their neck measurements exceed these thresholds. For every additional centimeter beyond that range, the likelihood of hospitalization and early death increases.</p>
<p>If your neck measurement falls above these levels, there&#x27;s no reason for alarm, but it&#x27;s worth noting. Neck size represents only one piece of your overall health profile, yet it can reveal important information that other metrics might overlook.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Bird flu hiding in cheese? The surprising new discovery</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092841.htm'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_7843b5e057b3.webp'></p>
<p>Cheese made from contaminated raw milk was found to contain infectious avian influenza virus, raising potential health concerns for consumers, according to new research. The study also found that no virus was detected in samples of raw milk cheese with high acidity. Feta cheese, which is naturally more acidic, served as an example of this safer variety.</p>
<p>The findings were published on October 8 in Nature Medicine.</p>
<p>Tracking How the H5N1 Virus Behaves in Cheese</p>
<p>&quot;In this study, we were specifically looking at the stability or persistence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in raw milk cheese products,&quot; said senior author Diego Diel, professor of virology in the Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences and director of the Virology Laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC), all in the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM).</p>
<p>&quot;This research was initiated due to previous work demonstrating high levels of virus shedding in milk from infected cows and the fact that we have previously shown that the virus survives in refrigerated raw milk for extended periods of time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Virus Survived Twice as Long as Expected</p>
<p>Under Food and Drug Administration guidelines, raw milk cheese must be aged for at least 60 days at or above 35 degrees Fahrenheit. This process helps reduce moisture and destroy harmful bacteria that may be present in unpasteurized milk. However, the researchers detected infectious H5N1 virus after 120 days of aging at 39 degrees Fahrenheit, suggesting that the standard aging period may not fully eliminate viral contamination.</p>
<p>Acidity Plays a Key Role in Cheese Safety</p>
<p>A pH level below 7 is considered acidic. Most cheeses have a pH between 5.4 (as in cheddar) and 7 (as in camembert). Some, like feta, can be as low as 4.6 or even lower.</p>
<p>When the pH of raw milk cheese was between 5.8 and 6.6, the virus remained viable. No virus was detected in cheeses with a pH of 5 or below. The results highlight acidity as a key factor in inactivating the pathogen during cheesemaking.</p>
<p>According to Diel, steps to prevent contamination could include testing milk before cheesemaking and using only virus-free milk. Another option is to heat milk to sub-pasteurization temperatures, which could inactivate the virus while maintaining the raw milk cheese characteristics valued by artisanal producers.</p>
<p>Nicole Martin, study co-author and assistant research professor in dairy foods microbiology, emphasized the importance of this work: &quot;The work we&#x27;ve done on H5N1 is critical to providing practical, timely, data-driven knowledge and recommendations to the dairy industry in the face of this outbreak that has affected a large proportion of the milk supply in the U.S., and it allows raw milk cheese makers to reduce risk.&quot;</p>
<p>Animal Tests Shed Light on Transmission</p>
<p>The study also included an animal experiment using ferrets, which are highly susceptible to H5N1. The animals were fed contaminated raw milk and raw milk cheese from the study. Some ferrets that drank the raw milk became infected, but those that ate the raw milk cheese did not.</p>
<p>Diel suggested that the difference may relate to how the virus interacts with the body. The fluid consistency of milk may allow the virus to make greater contact with mucous membranes in the throat, while cheese likely provides less exposure time for infection to begin.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Feeling stressed? Science finds a simple way to take back control</h2>
<p><em>Science Daily - <a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092833.htm'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_312f7283b695.webp'></p>
<p>A tight work deadline, a clogged toilet, or a disagreement with a loved one can make an ordinary day feel overwhelming. When several of these small frustrations build up, stress can quickly escalate. But according to new research that includes scientists from Penn State, simply feeling more in control might help make those everyday challenges easier to handle.</p>
<p>The study found that on days when people felt they had greater control over their stressors, they were 62% more likely to take action -- such as calling a plumber or addressing a difficult conversation -- to solve the problem. This effect became even stronger with age. The results suggest that a person&#x27;s sense of control can serve as an important psychological resource that can be strengthened over time to help manage stress and improve health outcomes.</p>
<p>The findings were published in the journal Communications Psychology.</p>
<p>&quot;This research shows that even small boosts in how much control people feel they have over everyday hassles make it more likely that those hassles actually get resolved,&quot; said David Almeida, professor of human development and family studies at Penn State and senior author on the paper. &quot;Learning to find and act on these pockets of control in daily life may not only reduce stress but also support long-term health and well-being.&quot;</p>
<p>Previous work led by Almeida has shown that stress responses fluctuate over time and that even minor daily inconveniences can affect health when they accumulate. Actively resolving stressors -- such as clearing up an argument -- is a key part of processing stress and allows emotions to settle more quickly.</p>
<p>Measuring How Control Affects Stress</p>
<p>In this new study, the researchers wanted to know whether a sense of personal control -- how much people feel they can influence their daily challenges -- affects whether a stressor gets resolved. For instance, does believing you can fix a billing mistake make you more likely to call the company? The team also examined what influences that sense of control, including the type of stress, how often stressors occur, and socioeconomic conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;If perceived stressor control promotes stress resolution, can we leverage that as a modifiable resource to influence stressor resolution and therefore our emotional health and well-being?&quot; asked lead author Dakota Witzel, who was a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for Healthy Aging at Penn State during the time of the research and is now an assistant professor at South Dakota State University.</p>
<p>Tracking Daily Stress Over a Decade</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed data from more than 1,700 adults who took part in the National Study of Daily Experiences, part of the long-running Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS), a national study on health and well-being. For eight consecutive days, participants reported any daily stressors they experienced within the previous 24 hours and whether each stressor was resolved by the end of the day. Common sources of stress included interpersonal tensions (arguments or avoided arguments), home or work overload, and &quot;network stress&quot; -- problems affecting friends or family that still caused distress for the participant.</p>
<p>Participants also rated how much control they felt over each stressor on a four-point scale (none, a little, some, or a lot of control). The same survey was repeated with these participants 10 years later to see whether the connection between perceived control and stress resolution changed with time.</p>
<p>Control Levels Fluctuate From Day to Day</p>
<p>Results showed that people&#x27;s sense of control can shift greatly from one day to the next. In other words, feeling in control is not a fixed personal trait -- it&#x27;s a daily perception that varies depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>Across all ages, on days when people felt more in control than usual -- for instance, feeling &quot;some&quot; control instead of &quot;a little&quot; -- they were significantly more likely to resolve the stressor. This pattern held true regardless of the stressor&#x27;s type or intensity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the connection grew stronger with age. Early in the study, participants who felt a higher-than-usual level of control were 61% more likely to resolve their stressors that day. A decade later, the same boost in perceived control raised that likelihood to 65%.</p>

<div class='article'><h2> We may already know what&#x27;s turning iPhone 17 Pro pink, and Apple&#x27;s iPhone cleaning guidance is the key </h2>
<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/we-may-already-know-whats-turning-iphone-17-pro-pink-and-apples-iphone-cleaning-guidance-is-the-key'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_607eb2a3445e.jpg'></p>
<p>Sometimes the easiest explanation is the most obvious</p>
<p>If you believe the reports and images on Reddit, there are some iPhone 17 Pro Cosmic Orange phones that are inexplicably turning pink. There aren&#x27;t many reported cases, but enough that some have already coined the term &quot;Colorgate.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s fun to have a new &quot;gate&quot; to consider, but what if there&#x27;s a simple, scientific explanation for these potential color shifts and the answer has been staring us in the face from one of Apple&#x27;s own support pages all along?</p>
<p>First, we reviewed the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max here and have yet to experience any fading. Even scratchgate hasn&#x27;t reached our new iPhones yet, but the hue and cry surrounding this new issue is such that it&#x27;s worth investigating.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s start by stepping back to understand the iPhone 17 Pro&#x27;s (and 17 Pro Max) finish, the process by which it&#x27;s made, and how it differs from the iPhone 16 Pro line&#x27;s titanium finish.</p>
<p>Titanium is a heavier, stronger metal than aluminum, and when it&#x27;s anodized (an electrochemical process), it adopts a smooth, non-porous finish. Anodizing aluminum, on the other hand, results in a porous finish that can be bathed in a special dye that soaks color into those pores and then is specially sealed.</p>
<p>Those differences in materials and the process by which the iPhone 17 Pro chassis is made allow for the richer iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max colors: Cosmic Orange and Deep Blue.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, Cosmic Orange has turned out to be the more popular color, which may account for the number of reports. But how might that lovely orange fade to an almost equally attractive reddish pink?</p>
<p>Oddly, a partial answer might be found here on this 2013 PF Finishing Products post by Mark Jazefowicz, VP of Technical Services, Reliant Aluminum Products. In it, Jazefowicz writes:</p>
<p>&quot;Color anodized aluminum is widely used as a material in the medical device industry. From tool handles to trays, these repeat-use devices undergo regular cleaning and sterilization treatments, and it is vital that the original finish remain preserved throughout.</p>
<p>Several types of sterilization methods are in use today, but those that incorporate hydrogen peroxide injection are particularly challenging for a color anodized finish to endure, since fading or significant discoloration typically occurs after only a few sterizliation cycles.&quot;</p>
<p>So, according to Jazefowicz, hydrogen peroxide, a chemical that&#x27;s occasionally used to bleach hair, is no friend to an anodized aluminum finish color.</p>
<p>If we needed more evidence, we need only look at Apple&#x27;s own guidance for iPhone cleaning.</p>
<p>Yes, 70% isopropyl alcohol is okay, as is a 75% ethyl alcohol wipe. Even Clorox Disinfecting Wipes pass muster when used gently. But the language is crystal clear: &quot;Don&#x27;t use products containing bleach or hydrogen peroxide.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple isn&#x27;t explaining here why you should never use those solvents, but based on the information from that decade-old-plus article, we can guess why.</p>

<p>OpenSFI layers above AMD&#x27;s openSIL and Intel&#x27;s FSP for unified function calls</p>
<p>A new collaboration between leading chipmakers and cloud firms will bring together AMD, Arm, Intel, Google, ByteDance, Microsoft, MiTAC, HPE, and others to create a more unified firmware foundation.</p>
<p>The initiative, known as openSFI (Open Silicon Firmware Interface), seeks to define a single, architecture-neutral interface for how host firmware communicates with CPU silicon during initialization and operation.</p>
<p>The project is notable for its broad membership, as ByteDance stands out as the only Chinese participant among American and European technology giants.</p>
<p>The openSFI project builds upon and complements AMD&#x27;s ongoing openSIL effort, which aims to replace the proprietary AGESA codebase for silicon initialization with a transparent, open-source alternative.</p>
<p>Within this new structure, openSFI acts as a unified layer sitting atop AMD&#x27;s openSIL and Intel&#x27;s FSP (Firmware Support Package).</p>
<p>In effect, it serves as a shared abstraction point that lets host firmware call standardized functions without concern for the underlying silicon vendor.</p>
<p>This approach could streamline platform development, reduce redundant engineering, and allow firmware to be reused across different CPUs.</p>
<p>The published openSFI 0.3 specification lays out the project&#x27;s design principles and integration model, noting its goal is to, &quot;enable modular, scalable, and vendor-agnostic integration of silicon into host firmware environments.&quot;</p>
<p>The specification emphasizes a stable API contract for host firmware to call silicon initialization functions predictably and consistently.</p>
<p>It also outlines the primary objectives of openSFI: unifying silicon initialization interfaces, simplifying firmware integration, and promoting reusability between vendors to cut validation costs and improve sustainability.</p>
<p>ByteDance&#x27;s involvement is notable in a field often dominated by Western and Japanese semiconductor firms.</p>
<p>By joining openSFI, ByteDance opens an unusual level of engagement between a Chinese tech firm and major U.S. semiconductor companies.</p>
<p>Although the ambition is promising, there is no information on how openSFI will be adopted across competing hardware ecosystems.</p>
<p>Previous attempts at firmware standardization have struggled due to differing vendor interests and evolving hardware platforms.</p>

<div class='article'><h2> Microsoft commits to making Windows 11 ‘AI-native’ - whether you like it or not </h2>
<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/pro/microsoft-commits-to-making-windows-11-ai-native-whether-you-like-it-or-not'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_3922f18cadda.jpg'></p>
<p>With Windows 10 hitting EOL, Windows 11 is set to become the AI OS</p>
<p>Now Windows 10 has reached its end-of-life, Microsoft has released more information on its future plans surrounding Windows 11, primarily concerning its commitment to turning the operating system &#x27;AI-native&#x27;.</p>
<p>With Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot AI &#x27;companion&#x27;, the organization wants to push users towards a fully integrated agentic AI experience - with AI no longer just being an &#x27;add on&#x27; tool to the OS, but rather a core part of Windows.</p>
<p>&quot;Windows leads the AI-native shift,&quot; said Stefan Kinnestrand, Vice President at Microsoft. &quot;Windows is evolving into an AI-native platform: secure, scalable, and built for agentic work,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>Copilot+ PCs will be on the hardware side of this commitment, with AI features on the software side, as Microsoft hints new &quot;breakthrough performance and native AI experiences&quot; are set to be arriving soon for Windows 11 users, but only those who already own a Copilot+ PC at first.</p>
<p>&quot;Windows is evolving to more effectively empower organizations to innovate, adapt, and thrive in a rapidly changing business landscape driven by AI &quot; Kinnestrand added.</p>
<p>&quot;With the latest AI features, organizations gain an enterprise-grade foundation where AI powered capabilities operate safely and effectively, unlocking new levels of productivity and business agility.&quot;</p>
<p>But what will this mean for users? Well, it means Copilot will be weaved into PCs with Windows 11, rather than pushing customers to purchase specific Copilot Plus PCs.</p>
<p>Microsoft wants its customers to communicate and work with their PC - out loud.</p>
<p>Workers will also soon get access to new Copilot Voice, Vision, and Action features. Copilot Voice enables voice commands to search, automate tasks, and &#x27;make daily work more intuitive and hands-free&#x27; - whilst Copilot Vision allows the AI access to your screen in real-time and offers analysis and provides instructions on using apps or completing tasks - both &#x27;opt-in permissions&#x27;.</p>
<p>Copilot Action will let Copilot agents perform tasks on the users behalf. Examples Microsoft have given are; &#x27;opening apps, changing settings, or starting workflows-based on context and intent&#x27; - not entirely ground breaking.</p>
<p>Despite all these features, Windows 11 and AI are &#x27;designed to make technology feel invisible, so employees can focus on what matters&#x27; Kinnestrand argues.</p>
<p>The Microsoft ecosystem with fully integrated technology is aimed at helping &#x27;reduce complexity, unlock cross-platform intelligence, and deliver seamless experiences across teams and tools.&#x27;</p>
<p>Finally, there&#x27;s &#x27;Click to Do&#x27;, a productivity tool which Microsoft says will empower users to &#x27;act instantly, such as scheduling meetings or launching tasks, directly from their workspace,&#x27; with workflows streamlined through a single click.</p>

<p><img src='article_images/preview_30661463f082.webp'></p>
<p>Built-in AI agents are ready to travel the web for you</p>
<p>ChatGPT Atlas folds ChatGPT capabilities directly into the browser itself. Instead of switching tabs to talk to a chatbot, the assistant is baked into the browsing experience. When you use Atlas, you&#x27;ll see both a webpage and a ChatGPT transcript that keeps the AI companion visible at all times (unless you turn it off). It can even fix up your writing in an email through what OpenAI calls cursor chat.</p>
<p>The AI can help summarize pages, fill out forms, make reservations, and perform other tasks automatically. The new browser represents OpenAI&#x27;s biggest step yet into software for daily use and offers a memory feature to personalize the experience and make it more useful on an individual level, as it can remember your preferences.</p>
<p>Atlas likely won&#x27;t feel unfamiliar to most web browsers. But under the hood, it seems like it&#x27;s running OpenAI&#x27;s Operator agent, an existing AI engine capable of navigating pages, executing actions, and adapting in real time.</p>
<p>For everyday users, the appeal is obvious. Forget juggling extensions, copying URLs into a chatbot, or manually typing the same shipping address for the fiftieth time. If Atlas works as promised, browsing could become not only more intelligent but also refreshingly low-maintenance.</p>

<p>A growing number of manufacturers are releasing mini PCs built around AMD&#x27;s Ryzen AI Max+ 395 &quot;Strix Halo&quot; processor.</p>
<p>It reaches clock speeds up to 5.1GHz and includes a dedicated AI engine capable of 50 trillion operations per second.</p>
<p>While big brands, like Dell, still haven&#x27;t crafted their own devices running the APU, a growing number of smaller brands have. These include Minisforum, Beelink, Geekom, and modular PC maker Framework. Most recently, GPD rolled out the WIN 5, which is more like a handheld games console.</p>
<p>Morefine now joins those lesser known names with the H1, a vertically oriented Strix Halo mini desktop aimed at professionals who want workstation performance in a small chassis.</p>
<p>The Morefine H1 adopts a tower-style layout featuring an aluminum shell with wide ventilation openings and an integrated 320W power supply.</p>
<p>Like other mini PCs built around AMD&#x27;s APU, the system includes 128GB of LPDDR5X in dual-channel configuration running at 8000MHz.</p>
<p>It comes with 2TB of NVMe SSD storage, but dual PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280 slots allow for up to 8TB.</p>
<p>Cooling duties are handled by dual fans, and a manual turbo mode button provides an instant boost for demanding workloads or rendering tasks.</p>
<p>The H1 includes Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, a 2.5G Ethernet port, dual USB4 connectors, and three USB-A 3.2 Gen2 ports.</p>
<p>Video output options include two HDMI 2.1 and two DisplayPort 1.4 ports for multi-monitor setups.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also a front SD 4.0 card reader, performance profile switch, and headphone jack.</p>
<p>Measuring 248.5 x 188.4 x 97.55 mm and weighing roughly 3kg, the Morefine H1 combines compact design with solid computing power.</p>

<div class='article'><h2> Nothing&#x27;s cool noise-cancelling headphones have hit a record-low price that makes them even more tempting </h2>
<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/nothings-cool-noise-cancelling-headphones-have-hit-a-record-low-price-that-makes-them-even-more-tempting'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_e279b6a28f63.jpg'></p>
<p>Nothing&#x27;s headphones are like no other, and now they&#x27;re an even better buy</p>
<p>Nothing and its sub-brand CMF are doing some really interesting things with headphones right now, such as CMF&#x27;s Headphone Pro. And the crown for most out-there headphones belongs to the Nothing Headphone (1), whose design means you definitely won&#x27;t mistake them for any other set of over-ears.</p>
<p>Right now those headphones are available with decent discounts: they&#x27;re down from $299 to $254 on Amazon US, and reduced even more on Amazon UK: there, the Nothing Headphone (1) are down from £299 to just £224. In both cases, that&#x27;s a record-low price.</p>
<p>These are very smart headphones, with highly effective noise cancellation, great comfort, and solid build quality. They&#x27;re in direct competition with the best noise-cancelling headphones, and with these discounts they undercut many of the big names.</p>
<p>Also, they make you look like one of Dr Who&#x27;s Cybermen. You can&#x27;t say that about a set of Sonys.</p>
<p>This deal on the Nothing Headphone (1) wireless headphones applies to both the white and black models, but I think if you&#x27;re going for them you should go for the silvery white ones: they show off the radical, retro-styled design best. There&#x27;s plenty of substance to match the style, with 80 hours of play time, Hi-Res Audio, spatial sound and tuning by audio legend Kef. And while they may look weird, they&#x27;re supremely comfortable for all-day wear.</p>
<p>As with the Amazon US deal, this offer is available for both the black and the white versions, and you should definitely go for the white ones before they sell out. This is a great discount on excellent over-ears: there&#x27;s LDAC audio, great ANC, USB-C audio for wired hi-res music and up to 80 hours of use with ANC off and a still impressive 35 hours with ANC on. They&#x27;re built tough, too, so they&#x27;re more than ready for the rigours of your commute or recreational run.</p>
<p>The Nothing Headphone (1) look like no other headphones: there&#x27;s a distinct echo of the OG Sony Walkman in their design. But as we said in our Nothing Headphone (1) review, while they may look retro there&#x27;s nothing old-fashioned about their features. They include tweakable ANC, useful audio customization, USB-C lossless audio and spatial audio too.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t a case of style over substance, or of design taking precedence over comfort. We found the Headphone (1) to be supremely comfortable and very well-made.</p>
<p>Spec-wise you&#x27;re looking at 40mm dynamic drivers, a frequency response of 20Hz to 40kHz, Bluetooth 5.3 with LDAC, and IP52 water and dust resistance.</p>
<p>Call us Nostradamus, but as we said in our review: &quot;If (well, when) they get a price drop, these could be great headphones.&quot; If you&#x27;ll pardon the grammar: that when is now.</p>

<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/how-to-watch/football/newcastle-vs-benfica-champions-league-2025-26-free'>original</a></em></p>

<p>Mourinho has an awful record at St James&#x27; Park, but he needs a statement win</p>
<p>With Bruno Guimaraes and Richard Rios stalking midfield and Jose Mourinho prowling the touchline, we expect Newcastle&#x27;s clash with Benfica to be nothing short of full-blooded. The self-proclaimed Special One took the Eagles reins a month ago, but with any discernable impact yet to be felt, this is his opportunity to make a mark.</p>
<p>While it&#x27;s early doors, Mourinho&#x27;s W3 D2 L1 record isn&#x27;t a step up from that of his predecessor Bruno Lage (W7 D2 L1), and for all the showbiz that came with it, his Chelsea reunion ended in defeat. Mourinho needs a statement result to get his Benfica stint up and running, so where better to secure it than at St James&#x27; Park, where he&#x27;s overseen five defeats, four draws and just three victories? The last of those draws came against a side managed by Steve Bruce.</p>
<p>Benfica&#x27;s two previous Champions League games have ended in defeat, but Vangelis Pavlidis - who scored a hat-trick against Barcelona in last season&#x27;s competition - has scored four in his last four, and the comative Nicolas Otamendi looks tailor-made for Mourinho&#x27;s style. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin, however, has developed a reputation for butter-fingers.</p>
<p>Not in his wildest dreams would Eddie Howe have envisaged the colossal impact that Nick Woltemade has made for the Magpies. The towering German has already contributed four goals, and Anthony Gordon in particular seems to have benefited from his arrival.</p>
<p>Read on for our guide on where to watch Newcastle vs Benfica live streams online, on TV and potentially for free wherever you are.</p>

<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/return-to-paradise-season-2-will-be-make-or-break-for-mack-and-glenns-relationship-as-star-teases-emotional-blocks-in-new-episodes'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_a3fba11f1ee2.jpg'></p>
<p>Return to Paradise season 2 returns (pardon the pun) to BBC iPlayer in the UK on October 31 and will be coming to ABC in Australia on November 15.</p>
<p>Typical Halloween content it is not, but don&#x27;t underestimate the drama that&#x27;s to come. As season 2 begins, Mack (Anna Sansom) is still stuck in Dolphin&#x27;s Cove, the home we saw her return to in season 1 after working for the Metropolitan Police in London.</p>
<p>This time around, there are brand-new cases to solve, an epic roster of guests stars and one question that won&#x27;t let go: Can Mack and Glenn (Tai Hara) properly be together?</p>
<p>After so much on-off tension, it&#x27;s a question I&#x27;ve been desperate to get to the bottom of. Thankfully, I had the chance to ask Anna Samson herself, and she&#x27;s teased some substantial &quot;emotional blocks&quot;... but not Mack&#x27;s.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Mackenzie feels doomed in her emotional life always. I don&#x27;t think she sees herself as lovable,&quot; Samson tells me. It&#x27;s not about the fact that she doesn&#x27;t love people or care about people. She thinks she&#x27;s unworthy of love in that capacity.</p>
<p>&quot;So I think a sense of loneliness is something she carries in her at all times, and that&#x27;s where the feeling of doom comes from.&quot;</p>
<p>She continues: &quot;It&#x27;s quite a tragic story in a lot of ways, those two characters. You get to see more of Glenn&#x27;s emotional blocks in season 2. It&#x27;s not just Mackenzie that&#x27;s making this difficult, he has a responsibility and his own problems.</p>
<p>&quot;They both bring their own psychology and their own damage, and we&#x27;ll see more of Glenn&#x27;s in season two.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a lot for any relationship, let alone a singular season of TV. If Return to Paradise follows its predecessors Death in Paradise and Beyond Paradise, we&#x27;ve got plenty of future seasons left to watch.</p>
<p>While we don&#x27;t know what challenges lie in Mack and Glenn&#x27;s path just yet, don&#x27;t be surprised if there are no clear resolutions in season 2 (and that&#x27;s a good thing).</p>

<p><em>TechRadar - <a href='https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/a-broad-censorship-regime-big-tech-and-students-hit-texas-age-verification-law-with-legal-complaints'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_c110cec67a79.jpg'></p>
<p>The Texas App Store Accountability Act is set to be enforced on January 1, 2026</p>
<p>A student journalist, a high school debater, a student advocacy organization, and a consortium of Big Tech giants walk into a room. No, it isn&#x27;t the beginning of a joke - they are all trying to halt the Texas new age verification law from taking effect.</p>
<p>Set to be enforced on January 1, 2026, the Texas App Store Accountability Act will require official app stores to perform mandatory age checks on anyone in the state before allowing them to download any mobile applications.</p>
<p>Teenagers would also be banned from downloading any app or making an in-app purchase without parental consent. In turn, parents must verify their identity to provide consent for every download or purchase.</p>
<p>According to the CCIA (Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association), these requirements violate the First Amendment &quot;by restricting app stores from offering lawful content, preventing users from seeing that content, and compelling app developers to speak of their offerings in a way pleasing to the state.&quot;</p>
<p>The Students Engaged in Advancing Texas (SEAT) agrees with Big Tech on this and filed a similar lawsuit. &quot;Students have just as much a right to access information as adults, and this law denies them that access,&quot; said Cameron Samuels, co-founder and Executive Director of SEAT.</p>
<p>The CCIA, which represents the likes of Apple, Google, and Amazon, has described the proposed rules as a &quot;misguided attempt to protect minors&quot; that seeks to go a step further than today&#x27;s parental control systems, since it requires everyone (not only minors) to prove their age before being able to do anything in the app stores.</p>
<p>Users can do so by uploading a valid form of government-issued identification to the platform. Yet, building such a database of sensitive details raises data privacy and security concerns, experts warn, as it can become a target for hacking or abuse.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not everything, though. &quot;The Texas App Store Accountability Act imposes a broad censorship regime on the entire universe of mobile apps,&quot; the CCIA warns in its lawsuit.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s because the law goes far beyond social media apps or adult-only websites, which are the target of most age verification laws in the US. It will age-gate all sorts of applications, including educational, news, and creative apps such as Wikipedia, Coursera, Spotify, and The New York Times, potentially hindering minors&#x27; ability to learn, communicate, and express themselves.</p>
<p>Yet, &quot;The First Amendment does not permit the government to require teenagers to get their parents&#x27; permission before accessing information, except in discrete categories like obscenity. The Constitution also forbids restricting adults&#x27; access to speech in the name of protecting children,&quot; said Ambika Kumar, a lawyer for the students&#x27; organization SEAT.</p>
<p>&quot;This law imposes a system of prior restraint on protected expression that is presumptively unconstitutional,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Whether they do so to protect their most sensitive personal data or they are minors looking to evade control, it&#x27;s hard to know for sure - most likely, it&#x27;s a mix of both.</p>

<p><img src='article_images/preview_4760e9af7c7e.jpg'></p>
<p>Man City are striving to keep their unbeaten run going in the Champions League</p>
<p>Man City travel to Villarreal this Tuesday night looking to bounce back from a disappointing draw with Monaco in the previous round of fixtures. Since an early-season blip against Tottenham and Brighton, Pep Guardiola&#x27;s side have looked closer to their best. They are currently in the midst of a nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions, with a win against Napoli and a draw with Monaco marking their opening results in the UCL.</p>
<p>Erling Haaland, as ever, is their danger man, with 14 goals already in the 2025/26 season. Elsewhere, Phil Foden is slowly rediscovering his 2023/24 form, while Jérémy Doku is beginning to deliver in the final third.</p>
<p>Over at Villarreal, their start to the season has been rather promising. While it&#x27;s always difficult to keep pace with Real Madrid and Barcelona, they&#x27;ve still managed 17 points from their opening nine fixtures. In Europe, they began their campaign with a narrow defeat to Spurs before netting a late equaliser to snatch a point against Juventus earlier this month. With former Premier League players like Nicolas Pépé, Juan Foyth, and Thomas Partey in the squad, the Cityzens will need to be wary of their opponents.</p>

<p>Cameron Norrie made it to the semi-finals of Wimbledon in 2022</p>
<p>Britain&#x27;s Cameron Norrie battled his way to victory over seventh seed Andrey Rublev to progress to the second round of the Erste Bank Open.</p>
<p>World number 35 Norrie won the two-hour match 6-2 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 in Austria.</p>
<p>Norrie, 30, started the match in fine fashion and took the opening set in just 34 minutes before breaking serve to move 2-0 up in the second.</p>
<p>The Briton served for the match at 5-4, but Rublev landed his first break of serve to force a tie-break, which he won to set up a deciding set.</p>
<p>Former world number eight Norrie regrouped to break Rublev&#x27;s serve in the second game to take command of the third set.</p>
<p>Norrie broke once more to book his spot in the next round, where he will face either Australia&#x27;s Alexei Popyrin or Italy&#x27;s Matteo Berrettini.</p>
<p>&quot;It was all round a really good performance, I was moving well and able to dictate the points,&quot; said Norrie.</p>
<p>&quot;I got a bit tight and tentative when I was serving for the match but credit to him staying in and competing.&quot;</p>

<p>Jannik Sinner was world number one until losing the US Open final to Carlos Alcaraz in September</p>
<p>Four-time Grand Slam champion Jannik Sinner will not be part of the Italy team aiming to clinch a third consecutive Davis Cup title next month.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old reached all four Grand Slam singles finals in 2025, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and won the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Saudi Arabia on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sinner is scheduled to take part in the ATP Tour Finals in Turin from 9-16 November, but Italy captain Filippo Volandri said the world number two had &quot;not given his availability&quot; to play at the Davis Cup in Bologna from 18-23 November.</p>
<p>World number one Carlos Alcaraz has been named in Spain&#x27;s team.</p>
<p>Sinner dominates Alcaraz at lucrative Six Kings Slam</p>
<p>&#x27;Sport must adapt&#x27;, says Draper after Rune injury</p>
<p>Sinner says he has taken the decision to miss the Davis Cup so he can have extra preparation time for the start of next season, with the Australian Open being the first Grand Slam of the year in January.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t an easy decision, but after Turin, the goal is to get off on the right foot in Australia,&quot; Sinner told Sky Sport Italy. &quot;It may not seem like it, but a week of preparation during that period can make all the difference.</p>
<p>&quot;We won the Davis Cup in 2023 and 2024, and this time we decided this with my team.&quot;</p>
<p>Lorenzo Musetti and Flavio Cobolli, eighth and 22nd in the world respectively, will be the highest-ranked singles players on show for Italy, who face Austria in their quarter-final.</p>
<p>Volandri said: &quot;The Davis Cup is, and will remain, always his home and I am sure that Jannik will soon be part of the team again.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime, I can count on a group ready to fight and give everything for the blue jersey.&quot;</p>
<p>Sinner&#x27;s absence comes after several players voiced concerns about a demanding tennis calendar in recent weeks.</p>
<p>After Holger Rune sustained a season-ending injury at the Nordic Open on Saturday, British number one Jack Draper posted on social media that &quot;the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity&quot;.</p>

<p>Camilla Rosatello has won two doubles titles on the WTA Challenger Tour</p>
<p>Venue: Wrexham Tennis and Padel Centre Date: 21-26 October</p>
<p>Coverage: Watch live on BBC Sport online and BBC iPlayer</p>
<p>Italy&#x27;s second seed Camilla Rosatello was knocked out in the opening match of the Wrexham Open by Slovakia&#x27;s Katarina Kuzmova.</p>
<p>Rosatello dropped the first set but bounced back to win the second on a tie-break to force a deciding set.</p>
<p>However, the 30-year-old was broken early in that final set by Kuzmova, and went on to lose 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (4-7) 6-4.</p>
<p>There was to be no such problem for fourth seed Kathinka von Deichmann of Liechtenstein or fifth seed Raluca Georgiana Serban of Cyprus.</p>
<p>Serban was forced to do things the hard way, however, after dropping the first set against Great Britain&#x27;s Ranah Akua Stoiber.</p>
<p>Serban responded by racing through the second set, and while Stoiber forced a tie-break in the decider, the 28-year-old Cypriot would go on to win 1-6 6-0 7-6 (7-5).</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the first round of the women&#x27;s singles there were straight-set wins for Jana Otzipka, Elena Malygina, and Lucie Havlickova, plus Britain&#x27;s Amarni Banks, who is ranked 295th in the world and beat Finland&#x27;s Laura Hietaranta 6-4 6-0.</p>
<p>Mimi Xu was beaten by Emma Raducanu in the first round of the women&#x27;s singles at Wimbledon this year</p>
<p>The home crowd in attendance in Wrexham on the opening day were firmly behind Welsh 18-year-old Mimi Xu in the first round of the women&#x27;s doubles.</p>
<p>Xu and McDonald continued their dominance into the second set, and dropped just two further games on the way to completing a 6-3 6-2 win in north Wales.</p>
<p>They will face third seeds Naima Karamoko of Switzerland and Jessika Ponchet of France in the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Ponchet and Karamoko cruised through 6-0 6-1 against Britain&#x27;s Georgiana Mititelu and Elizabeth Evans.</p>

<p>Mimi Xu enjoyed notable wins at tournaments in Birmingham, Ilkley and Nottingham last season</p>
<p>Venue: Wrexham Tennis and Padel Centre Date: 20-26 October</p>
<p>Coverage: Watch live on BBC Sport online and BBC iPlayer</p>
<p>Teenage tennis star Mimi Xu says her driving test was far more stressful than playing Emma Raducanu on her Wimbledon debut.</p>
<p>Wildcard Xu won the hearts of the nation when she became the first Welsh player to enter the All England Club&#x27;s main singles draw in 20 years.</p>
<p>Xu drew British number one Raducanu in her first-round match and played in front of thousands on Court One.</p>
<p>But the 18-year-old from Swansea says her practical driving test was much more of an ordeal.</p>
<p>&quot;Leading up to the moment I passed, I was so tense, there was no way I could have driven back afterwards,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;My mum doesn&#x27;t trust me enough yet to drive on the big roads!&quot;</p>
<p>Wrexham to host north Wales&#x27; biggest tennis event</p>
<p>Xu is one of 12 British hopes in the Wrexham Open, the biggest tennis event to come to Wales in almost 30 years.</p>
<p>Fresh from winning a W35 doubles title in Birmingham and with a career-best singles ranking of 309, Xu is hopeful of having a good run in north Wales.</p>
<p>She has been drawn against the number three seed, Lithuania&#x27;s Justina Mikulskyte.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m feeling confident in my game, I&#x27;m ready to go, ready to compete,&quot; Xu said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is at the level now where they can beat anyone on their day. Now that I&#x27;m 18 I get to play freely, there is always next week.</p>

<p>Katie Boulter has not made it past the second round at a Grand Slam in 2025</p>
<p>British number three Katie Boulter&#x27;s poor run of form continued with a straight-sets loss to world number 44 Eva Lys in the first round of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Boulter, 29, was beaten 6-2 6-1 in just one hour and 14 minutes by the 23-year-old German.</p>
<p>After coming through two rounds of qualifying, she was the only British player in the main draw after Emma Raducanu withdrew, ending her season early through illness.</p>
<p>This latest defeat caps a disappointing run of form, which has seen the former world number 29 unable to progress beyond the second round of a tournament since the Nottingham Open in June.</p>
<p>It also comes five days after the Briton lost in straight sets in the second round of the Japan Open by world number 51 Sorana Cirstea.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, British number four Fran Jones was beaten in straight sets by China&#x27;s Wang Xiyu in the first round of the Guangzhou Open.</p>
<p>Seventh seed Jones was broken four times in the match as she lost 6-4 6-4 to the world number 163.</p>

<p>Nineteen of Daniil Medvedev&#x27;s 21 titles have been won on hard courts</p>
<p>A resurgent Daniil Medvedev claimed his first title for 882 days with victory over Corentin Moutet in the Almaty Open final.</p>
<p>The Russian former world number one has had a torrid year, winning just one match at the Grand Slams and suffering a meltdown at the US Open.</p>
<p>Medvedev&#x27;s inconsistency on the ATP Tour - and struggles with his serve in particular - led to him dropping out of the world&#x27;s top 10 and ultimately splitting with long-time coach Gilles Cervara.</p>
<p>Now working with Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke, Medvedev has steadily improved in the past month - culminating in a hard-fought 7-5 4-6 6-3 victory over Frenchman Moutet.</p>
<p>It is Medvedev&#x27;s first title since the 2023 Rome Masters and first on a hard court since March of that year.</p>
<p>Victory also means Medvedev has won 21 titles at 21 different tournaments.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m at a tournament with my two daughters together, so to get a title is really nice,&quot; said world number 14 Medvedev.</p>
<p>&quot;This title is in honour of my second daughter, Victoria, because the first title I got when my first daughter Alisa was born was for her.&quot;</p>

<p>Sinner dominates Alcaraz at lucrative Six Kings Slam</p>
<p>Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion, had lost his past six finals, including in Halle earlier this year.</p>
<p>His defensive play style and frequent outbursts on court had led some to wonder if his ability to compete at the top level was over.</p>
<p>But the 29-year-old has made changes in recent weeks, making an effort to come to the net and play aggressively, backed up by an improved serve.</p>

<p>Jannik Sinner claimed a commanding victory over rival Carlos Alcaraz to win the lucrative Six Kings Slam in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Sinner, replaced as world number one by Alcaraz following the US Open in September, exacted revenge for his defeat in the New York final with a 6-2 6-4 win.</p>
<p>While the pair split the four Grand Slam titles between them this season, Sinner was dominant from the outset against Alcaraz, who said his opponent was &quot;just too good&quot; on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sinner broke Alcaraz&#x27;s serve in the opening game and swiftly wrapped up the first set, with the Spaniard unable to gain a foothold against his opponent&#x27;s clinical serving.</p>
<p>He would go on to win the exhibition event for the second consecutive year after making the decisive breakthrough in the seventh game of the second set.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could play like this everywhere,&quot; Sinner said in his on-court interview.</p>
<p>&quot;This season we played many, many times and I also lost many times to Carlos. It is a huge pleasure and honour to share the court with him.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very special friendship and it&#x27;s very nice.&quot;</p>

<p>Rating Raducanu&#x27;s season - and what does future hold?</p>
<p>Six of the world&#x27;s top men&#x27;s players competed at the three-day exhibition event in Saudi Arabia, which was streamed on Netflix.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has been accused of using its investment in sports and high-profile events to improve its image - known as &#x27;sportswashing&#x27; - amid criticism over its human rights record.</p>
<p>Alcaraz beat Taylor Fritz in straight sets to reach the final and Sinner overpowered joint-record 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic, who withdrew from his third-place play-off after losing the first set against Fritz earlier on Saturday.</p>
<p>Together, Sinner and Alcaraz have won nine of the sport&#x27;s past 10 majors and met in each of the last three slam finals in the early years of a burgeoning rivalry which has gripped the sport.</p>

<p>British number one Jack Draper says the tennis calendar must be adapted after Holger Rune became the latest high-profile player to have his season ended prematurely.</p>
<p>Danish 22-year-old Rune, set to return to the world&#x27;s top 10 after reaching the semi-finals at the Nordic Open in Stockholm, was forced to retire with injury when leading Frenchman Ugo Humbert by a set.</p>
<p>Rune&#x27;s mother, Aneke, later told Danish newspaper BT that she had been informed by medical staff that her son&#x27;s injury was &quot;very bad&quot;.</p>
<p>She said: &quot;They are completely sure that it is a torn Achilles tendon, so it&#x27;s of course very bad. Holger is completely devastated. They say they can see it with the naked eye.&quot;</p>
<p>Draper wrote on X: &quot;Injuries are going to happenâ¦ we are pushing our bodies to do things they aren&#x27;t supposed to in elite sport.</p>
<p>&quot;We have so many incredible younger guys on the tour right now and I&#x27;m proud to be a part of that.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity.&quot;</p>
<p>Rune, nursing a hamstring issue coming into the match, appeared instantly aware of the severity of his injury and was emotional as he received treatment after hobbling to his chair.</p>
<p>He had pulled up in pain after jumping to hit a ball at the back of the court, with the game level at 40-40 on Humbert&#x27;s serve and Rune leading 6-4 2-2.</p>
<p>Humbert said: &quot;It was not the way I wanted to win. I&#x27;m super disappointed for Holger, I hope he is going to be OK.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish him a speedy recovery. It was a great match, he was playing a little bit better than me, but I&#x27;m really sorry for Holger.&quot;</p>
<p>Later on Saturday, Novak Djokovic also retired after losing the first set of his third-place play-off against Taylor Fritz at the Six Kings Slam in Saudi Arabia - an exhibition event - having struggled with injury and sickness at last week&#x27;s Shanghai Masters.</p>
<p>Carlos Alcaraz, who finished runner-up to Jannik Sinner at the Saudi Arabia event which is not part of the ATP Tour, criticised the congested tennis calendar in September, saying &quot;they are going to kill us in some way&quot;.</p>
<p>Naomi Osaka became the latest high-profile player to withdraw from a tournament because of injury when she pulled out of the Japan Open with a leg problem before her quarter-final on Friday.</p>
<p>Former women&#x27;s world number one Iga Swiatek complained in September that the season is &quot;too long and too intense&quot; amid a string of injuries among players at the China Open.</p>

<p>Naomi Osaka&#x27;s last Grand Slam trophy came at the Australian Open in 2021</p>
<p>Naomi Osaka has pulled out of the Japan Open before Friday&#x27;s quarter-final because of a leg injury sustained in the second round.</p>
<p>The former world number one held back tears and needed painkillers to come through a three-set last-16 win over defending champion Suzan Lamens on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Top seed Osaka, who completed the match with strapping on her left thigh, was due to face Jaqueline Cristian in the last eight but the Romanian will instead progress to the semi-finals.</p>
<p>The Japan Open made the announcement on X, saying: &quot;We regret to announce that Naomi Osaka has not recovered from a left leg injury sustained during the second round of this tournament and has withdrawn from the quarter-finals scheduled for today.&quot;</p>
<p>It is not yet known whether Osaka will play in the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo later this month.</p>
<p>The four-time Grand Slam champion is the latest high-profile player to suffer late-season injury or health issues.</p>
<p>In September, Iga Swiatek complained the season is &quot;too long and too intense&quot; following a string of injuries among players at the China Open.</p>
<p>British number one Emma Raducanu called time on her season on Thursday after retiring from her two previous matches with illness.</p>
<p>Australia&#x27;s Daria Kasatkina, Ukraine&#x27;s Elina Svitolina and Spain&#x27;s Paula Badosa also ended their seasons early in recent weeks, citing either injury or a pressing need to take a break from the tour.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Rating Raducanu&#x27;s season - and what does future hold?</h2>

<p><img src='article_images/preview_d66b97faedc8.jpg'></p>
<p>Emma Raducanu is back inside the world&#x27;s top 30 for the first time in three years</p>
<p>Emma Raducanu completed a half-century of matches in a season for the first time in her career.</p>
<p>They included a semi-final showing in Washington, plus a quarter-final in Miami and a last-16 appearance on the Rome clay at WTA 1000 level.</p>
<p>There were also chastening defeats by the world&#x27;s elite on the Grand Slam stage and a frustrating conclusion in Asia with illness, a bad back and missed match points.</p>
<p>But the British number one&#x27;s decision to curtail her season two weeks early, and miss events in Tokyo and Hong Kong because of lingering sickness, is a sound one.</p>
<p>Raducanu has contested 22 tournaments this year, and was also in Auckland and set to play on New Year&#x27;s Eve before withdrawing because of her back. That is more than enough.</p>
<p>She now has 11 weeks to recover, rest and train for the 2026 season.</p>
<p>Raducanu will not need to worry about a coach in that period, as she and Francisco Roig - who was part of Rafael Nadal&#x27;s team for his 22 Grand Slam titles - have agreed to continue a partnership which began in August.</p>
<p>The numbers underline this was Raducanu&#x27;s best year since winning the 2021 US Open as a teenage qualifier in only her fourth tour-level event.</p>
<p>Physically, the 22-year-old has proved a lot more robust - even if her back is becoming a familiar foe.</p>
<p>It cost her vital preparation time last December and was a regular irritation on the clay and grass before stopping her in her tracks at the Ningbo Open this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Structurally I&#x27;m more prone and susceptible to picking up things like this,&quot; Raducanu said of her back in May.</p>
<p>Raducanu believes it is also now more reliable in tight moments, and she was generally very adept at saving break points this season.</p>
<p>Of Raducanu&#x27;s 22 defeats, only seven came against lower-ranked opponents, with three in the past month alone.</p>
<p>But beating the very best, who often possess greater power, has proved beyond her so far.</p>

<p>Sean Dyche has signed a deal with Nottingham Forest until summer 2027</p>
<p>New Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche wants his under-performing stars to reconnect with disillusioned supporters.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old became Forest&#x27;s third manager in six weeks when he replaced Ange Postecoglou on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Postecoglou was dismissed 39 days after he came in for the sacked Nuno Espirito Santo on 9 September.</p>
<p>Former Tottenham boss Postecoglou struggled to win over supporters, who chanted he would be &quot;sacked in the morning&quot; during a 3-2 Europa League defeat by Midtjylland last month.</p>
<p>Dyche came through the Forest academy in the 1980s, although he never made a first-team appearance, and is eager to unify the City Ground.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to get back on the front foot, in old football terminology, and hopefully give the crowd something to cheer about and reconnect,&quot; Dyche told BBC Radio Nottingham.</p>
<p>&quot;The Forest fans in my experience have been very fair down the years and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s far away from the team reconnecting. The first thing is performances, get them back on that winning edge they have shown.&quot;</p>
<p>Is Dyche the right man to repair Forest?</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest appoint Dyche as new manager</p>
<p>Inside Postecoglou&#x27;s 39 days to forget at Forest</p>
<p>Forest finished seventh in the Premier League last season under Nuno, their highest placing for 30 years, but they sit 18th and have not won since the opening day of this campaign.</p>
<p>They face Porto in the Europa League in Dyche&#x27;s first game on Thursday before travelling to Bournemouth on Sunday.</p>
<p>Forest have not kept a clean sheet for 20 games, since beating Manchester United in April. They will host United at the City Ground on 1 November.</p>
<p>&quot;The basics have always got to be in place,&quot; said Dyche.</p>

<p>Recruit a raft of former professionals who have played at the highest level of club and international football as you target more silverware.</p>
<p>Manchester club Wythenshawe AFC, external have an amateur vets team with nine former Premier League players in their current squad.</p>
<p>BBC Sport takes a closer look at the Sunday league dream team.</p>
<p>Wythenshawe Vets Over-35s are based in south Manchester and play in the Cheshire Vets League Premier Division.</p>
<p>Their squad list this season boasts nine former Premier League players, with a combined 1,801 top-flight appearances.</p>
<p>The elite roster also contains 222 Premier League goals and 325 international caps.</p>
<p>They include Papiss Cisse, who scored 37 goals in 117 appearances for Newcastle United after joining for Â£9m from Bundesliga side Freiburg in January 2012.</p>
<p>Cisse made his debut for Wythenshawe in their last home game against reigning champions Collegiate Old Boys and scored all six goals in a 6-2 win - including a 32-minute first-half hat-trick.</p>
<p>Wythenshawe&#x27;s squad for this season also includes former pros such as England and Liverpool striker Emile Heskey, Hull and Burnley winger George Boyd, Everton striker Oumar Niasse, Wigan full-back Maynor Figueroa, Manchester City duo Stephen Ireland and Nedum Onuoha and Premier League title winners Joleon Lescott and Danny Drinkwater.</p>
<p>Collectively, the former top-flight players have won 15 major trophies and moved for combined transfer fees of about Â£123m.</p>
<p>Stephen Ireland won six Republic of Ireland caps, scoring four goals</p>
<p>Ireland began playing for the team during pre-season this summer through close friend and current Wythenshawe player Blake Norton, and the former Republic of Ireland midfielder then invited other ex-pros, who all play in a midweek nine-a-side game, to join in.</p>
<p>Former Senegal forward Niasse, who scored 12 goals in 65 Premier League games for Everton and still attends their home games, also made his debut against Collegiate OB - who are based in Liverpool and wear an Everton training kit as their strip.</p>

<p><img src='article_images/preview_8c0a8a3ef9e2.jpg'></p>
<p>Danny Rohl has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Rangers</p>
<p>Danny Rohl delivered a simple message as he was introduced as Rangers head coach: &quot;We want to win.&quot;</p>
<p>The German, 36, has replaced Russell Martin, who left Ibrox after 17 games, only five of which were victories.</p>
<p>Rangers trail Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts by 13 points and defending champions Celtic by eight.</p>
<p>In the Europa League, Martin oversaw defeats in Rangers&#x27; opening two league phase fixtures.</p>
<p>&quot;We know where we are at the moment,&quot; said Rohl. &quot;We want to win, we need wins because we want to turn around the position at the moment. We are not happy.</p>
<p>&quot;I looked for a club to win titles and this club has everything for all these goals. It&#x27;s amazing to be part of here.&quot;</p>
<p>What did we learn from Rohl&#x27;s Rangers unveiling?</p>
<p>&#x27;I see so much potential&#x27; - Rohl introduced as Rangers head coach</p>
<p>Rohl gave an insight into his tactical approach, with Rangers having struggled defensively this term and also been blunt in attack.</p>
<p>&quot;My focus is on my person, what I can bring to this football club,&quot; the former Sheffield Wednesday boss said. &quot;I see so much potential.</p>
<p>&quot;My football, what I want to see on the pitch is intensity, it&#x27;s sprinting, it&#x27;s a togetherness and a playing forward style because we want to create chances, we want to create goals.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to speed up our game. We want to attack the last line. If you do it again, we create more chances and we have more goals.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to defend as a group, as a unit much, much better with a lot of aggression in the duels.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to press well, we have to hunt, we have to go in the counter pressing and we have to play with intensity, and it starts from the striker to the defender. If you do it as a unit, then it&#x27;s very hard to beat us and to break us down.</p>

<p>Heather Knight and Nat Sciver-Brunt were England&#x27;s leading run-scorers during the Ashes</p>
<p>England&#x27;s reunion with their greatest rivals Australia could not have come at a better time.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year England were humiliated in the Ashes. The 16-0 clean sweep was a non-contest, resulting in a complete overhaul of their leadership and a review - as is often prompted by an Ashes hammering, men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s.</p>
<p>Players have spoken about the scars left as a result, and while it is impossible to have a low-stakes England v Australia showdown, Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards have been presented with a golden opportunity to show that they have healed.</p>
<p>When they face each other in the group stage of the Women&#x27;s World Cup in Indore on Wednesday, England will be desperate to enact some revenge, but there is not a huge amount of pressure or expectation - and that could work in their favour.</p>
<p>Both teams are unbeaten, and both have already booked their place in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>The result of the game will play a big part in deciding who finishes top of the table, but other than that, it feels like its psychological consequences will be far more significant - particularly for England.</p>
<p>However, World Cup holders Australia have been dealt a hammer blow by losing their captain and the tournament&#x27;s leading run-scorer Alyssa Healy to a calf injury, which will force them to rejig their line-up with Georgia Voll likely to open, Tahlia McGrath to captain and Beth Mooney to keep wicket.</p>
<p>Australia have a title to defend, England have a point to prove.</p>
<p>If they give even the slightest hint that the Ashes drubbing is still lurking in their minds, Australia are ruthless and will pounce.</p>
<p>England through to semi-finals - who can join them?</p>
<p>England &#x27;got away with it&#x27; against Pakistan - Edwards</p>
<p>England beat India in thriller to seal Women&#x27;s World Cup semi-final spot</p>
<p>The fallout and scrutiny on England after the Ashes was so significant that it was never going to be a quick fix for Edwards, who was ushered in to replace Jon Lewis in the aftermath.</p>
<p>Even here in India and Sri Lanka, where they are unbeaten, there are still areas needed to improve considerably if they are to kick on past the semi-finals, most notably a fragile middle order which is relying heavily on Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight.</p>

<p>South Africa knock Pakistan out of World Cup in rain-affected match</p>
<p>ICC Women&#x27;s World Cup, Colombo</p>
<p>South Africa 312-9 (40 overs): Wolvaardt 90 (82); Nashra 3-45</p>
<p>Pakistan 83-7 (20 overs): Sidra Nawaz 22* (33); Kapp 3-20</p>
<p>South Africa won by 150 runs (Duckworth-Lewis-Stern)</p>
<p>South Africa returned to the top of the table and eliminated Pakistan from the World Cup with a 150-run win on the DLS method in a rain-plagued match in Colombo.</p>
<p>It looked like the weather would wash out another match in the Sri Lankan capital, with rain halting play for nearly two and a half hours just two overs into South Africa&#x27;s innings and returning 10 overs into Pakistan&#x27;s chase.</p>
<p>However, South Africa were able to complete a 40-over innings, with three players scoring half-centuries and Nadine de Klerk blasting 41 (16) to propel the Proteas to 312-9.</p>
<p>Pakistan were then restricted to 83-7 chasing a rain-reduced 234 from 20 overs, down from their initial revised target of 306 in 40 overs and later 262 from 25 overs after multiple disruptions.</p>
<p>Bottom side Pakistan, who needed to win their final two group matches to keep their semi-final hopes alive, join Bangladesh in being eliminated with a game to spare.</p>
<p>Already qualified South Africa, meanwhile, move one point clear of Australia and England, who meet in Indore on Wednesday.</p>
<p>South Africa lost opener Tazmin Brits for her third duck of the tournament in the second over but came out swinging after the rain delay.</p>
<p>Laura Wolvaardt, top scoring with 90, and Sune Luus (61) combined for 118 for the second wicket to lay the foundations for an imposing total before late runs from Marizanne Kapp (68 not out) and De Klerk carried the Proteas beyond 300.</p>
<p>In reply, Ayabonga Khaka removed Muneeba Ali in the second over before Kapp struck three times in 10 deliveries to reduce Pakistan to 35-4 before the rain returned.</p>
<p>After a truncated two-over return, Pakistan were eventually tasked with scoring 186 runs from eight overs to complete the required 20 overs to constitute a match, and with South Africa running deliveries and turning down reviews, they beat both the weather and Pakistan to secure the two points.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Wales recall Rees-Zammit for autumn Tests</h2>
<p><em>BBC Sport - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cj3zn12m37mo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_b986223d7f1a.jpg'></p>
<p>Louis Rees-Zammit played for Gloucester before his move to the NFL</p>
<p>Wales have recalled wing Louis Rees-Zammit for their autumn Tests, two years after he last played for his country and switched from rugby union to American football.</p>
<p>Despite winning contracts with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars during an 18-month period, Rees-Zammit did not play a competitive NFL game.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old returned to rugby in August by signing a season-long deal at Bristol Bears, for whom he made a try-scoring debut in the Gallagher Prem.</p>
<p>New head coach Steve Tandy&#x27;s first squad for the four matches in November also features recalls for Saracens prop Rhys Carre and Cardiff fly-half Callum Sheedy.</p>
<p>But Cardiff&#x27;s in-form teenage wing Tom Bowen misses out on a first call-up, while experienced Ospreys and Leicester back rows Ross Moriarty and Tommy Reffell are overlooked.</p>
<p>There are five uncapped players in the 39-man squad: Ospreys second row James Fender and back row Morgan Morse, Dragons hooker Brodie Coghlan, Cardiff prop Danny Southworth and Bath centre Louie Hennessey.</p>
<p>British and Irish Lions flanker Jac Morgan returns to lead the 744-cap squad, which has an average age of 26.</p>
<p>On Rees-Zammit, Tandy said: &quot;I think we&#x27;re getting a special athlete and a special mindset to go and try something new. Most people are probably not brave enough to experience something different and that was a big jump so that tells you a lot about him as a person and his mentality.</p>
<p>&quot;He says to me that he&#x27;s definitely faster and bigger since he&#x27;s come back, so that&#x27;s good for us to hear. We&#x27;ve got to build a game where we can get him in the game more often. Not only him, but we&#x27;ve got lots of other exciting players.&quot;</p>
<p>Bristol head coach Pat Lam said: &quot;It&#x27;s massive for Zam, it&#x27;s well deserved. At this stage he&#x27;s rehabbing but we, he, Wales [are] hoping he&#x27;ll be right for Argentina.</p>
<p>&quot;His rehab&#x27;s going really well, it&#x27;s a couple of weeks. Wales are happy, the medical teams are happy that he&#x27;s on track so this is a massive part for him as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Wales&#x27; players will assemble at their training base on the outskirts of Cardiff on Monday, 27 October.</p>
<p>Tandy will then begin his tenure with a match against Argentina on Sunday, 9 November, with Tests against Japan, New Zealand and South Africa to follow.</p>
<p>Those fixtures, which will be broadcast live on BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru, represent a formidable first assignment for ex-Scotland defence coach Tandy.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>England aim to avoid late loss pain in Ashes opener</h2>
<p><em>BBC Sport - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/articles/cvg7e623dgro?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>

<p>Shaun Wane will face Australia for the first time as England coach on Saturday at Wembley</p>
<p>England must avoid a repeat of some agonising late defeats if they are to win the first rugby league Ashes series for 22 years, says coach Shaun Wane.</p>
<p>Wane&#x27;s side have been haunted by a golden point extra-time defeat by Samoa in their World Cup semi-final three years ago.</p>
<p>There is also historical pain to overcome when they face Australia at Wembley on Saturday.</p>
<p>The last time the Ashes were staged, in 2003, Australia won all three Tests against a Great Britain side made up largely of English players.</p>
<p>All three were closely fought, with Australia winning each by six points or fewer. Britain also led during the second half of every game.</p>
<p>After Saturday&#x27;s match at Wembley, England face Australia at Everton&#x27;s Hill Dickinson Stadium on 1 November and at AMT Headingley on 8 November. All three matches are 14:30 kick-offs and will be live on BBC One.</p>
<p>The record attendance for an England rugby league international, of 67,545 against New Zealand at Wembley in the 2013 World Cup semi-finals, is set to be challenged as both sides aim to start with victory.</p>

<p>Why has Rugby League Ashes waited so long for revival?</p>
<p>Consign my Ashes try to history - Davies&#x27; England challenge</p>
<p>Returning to London for the first time since that painful 27-26 golden point loss to Samoa three years ago, Wane says he has hammered the need to play at full tempo for the entire duration.</p>
<p>&quot;I have talked with the players [about late defeats],&quot; Wane told a media conference at Wembley on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;No matter how close we come is irrelevant. I have spoken to the players about scenarios, and the importance of switching on for 80 minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;We will show Australia respect, and make sure we are switched on right to the very end.&quot;</p>

<p>Club: Barcelona Position: Midfielder</p>
<p>It has been quite the year for Aitana Bonmati. She became the first player to win three women&#x27;s Ballons d&#x27;Or, achieved a domestic treble and reached the Euro 2025 final.</p>
<p>Her pedigree is evident, with an extensive trophy haul across her career to boot. She has won seven league titles, three European crowns, nine Copas de la Reina and five Spanish Super Cups.</p>
<p>While Barcelona were beaten by Arsenal in the Champions League final, and her remarkable return from a bout of viral meningitis shortly before the start of the Euros was not enough to guide Spain to the trophy, it was an impressive campaign.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Plans for Trump-Putin meeting shelved days after Budapest talks proposed</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjp73gp41o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_50edd5560c39.jpg'></p>
<p>The US president said last Thursday that he and his Russian counterpart would hold talks in Budapest within two weeks to discuss the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was due to be held this week - but the White House said the two had had a &quot;productive&quot; call and that a meeting was no longer &quot;necessary&quot;.</p>
<p>The White House did not share any more details on why the talks had been put on hold.</p>
<p>But key differences between US proposals and Russia&#x27;s conditions for peace became increasingly clear this week, and appear to have dashed chances of a summit between the two presidents.</p>
<p>Trump had discussed a Budapest summit over the phone with Putin, a day before meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.</p>
<p>Some reports suggested those talks had been a &quot;shouting match&quot;, with sources suggesting Trump had pushed Zelensky to give up large areas of territory in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known collectively as the Donbas, as part of a deal with Russia.</p>
<p>However, Zelensky has always said Ukraine cannot relinquish the parts of the Donbas it still holds, on the grounds that Russia could later use the area as a springboard for further attacks.</p>
<p>On Monday, Trump embraced a ceasefire proposal backed by Kyiv and European leaders to freeze the conflict on the current front line.</p>
<p>&quot;Let it be cut the way it is,&quot; he said. &quot;I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia has repeatedly pushed back against freezing the current line of contact.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that &quot;the consistency of Russia&#x27;s position doesn&#x27;t change&quot; - referring to Moscow&#x27;s insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.</p>
<p>Moscow was only interested in &quot;long-term, sustainable peace&quot;, Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.</p>
<p>The &quot;root causes of the conflict&quot; needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine - a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, European leaders put out a statement with Zelensky saying that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line and accused Russia of not being &quot;serious&quot; about peace.</p>
<p>Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August, during a hastily organised summit which yielded no concrete results.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Third survivor quits grooming gang inquiry panel</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykd173l3vo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_e2c4ae355508.jpg'></p>
<p>A third abuse survivor has resigned from their role in the government&#x27;s inquiry into grooming gangs.</p>
<p>&quot;Elizabeth&quot; - not her real name - joined Fiona Goddard and Ellie Reynolds, who quit the inquiry&#x27;s victims and survivors liaison panel on Monday in protest.</p>
<p>In her resignation letter, Elizabeth said the process felt like &quot;a cover-up&quot; and had &quot;created a toxic environment for survivors&quot;.</p>
<p>Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has denied claims of a cover-up and insisted her government was &quot;committed to exposing the failures&quot; to tackle &quot;these appalling crimes&quot;.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who is from Rotherham, said she felt the process had been &quot;scripted and predetermined&quot;, &quot;rather than emerging from honest, open dialogue with survivors&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This sense of control and stage-management has left many of us questioning whether our voices truly matter, or whether we are being used to legitimise decisions that have already been made,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Survivors have been concerned that if people are already giving up on the inquiry it will not be able to gain the trust and confidence of others affected.</p>
<p>There is also frustration around the length of time it has taking to appoint a chairperson, with some seeing this as a delay tactic because of fears of what might be exposed.</p>
<p>The government is under pressure to come up with a plan that satisfies the survivors at the heart of this scandal.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced in June there would be a national inquiry into grooming gangs covering England and Wales, with a panel of survivors set up to oversee the process.</p>
<p>However, a chairperson has yet to be appointed.</p>
<p>The BBC has been told former senior social worker Annie Hudson, who had been named as a potential chairperson, has withdrawn following recent media coverage over her candidacy.</p>
<p>One of the other names being considered is former deputy chief constable Jim Gamble.</p>
<p>A meeting between Mr Gamble and survivors took place earlier, with both sides said to have listened to each other&#x27;s perspectives.</p>
<p>Ms Goddard and Ms Reynolds had raised concerns about the suitability of the candidates shortlisted to chair the inquiry, arguing they should not have a background in policing or social work.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>The deal that means Prince Andrew can still afford to live in Royal Lodge</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmx1gxv1e7o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_208448af8e77.jpg'></p>
<p>More details have emerged about how Prince Andrew can afford his sprawling 30-room Windsor mansion, in a lease agreement which has been revealed.</p>
<p>The arrangement means he has only ever paid a token annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate, a document seen by BBC News confirms.</p>
<p>The deal meant that instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments up-front, including for renovations.</p>
<p>In effect, those payments - which totalled around £8m - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the 75-year lease.</p>
<p>Details about Prince Andrew&#x27;s living arrangements have been scrutinised as controversy continues over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a scandal which has been reignited by new sexual abuse allegations contained in Virginia Giuffre&#x27;s posthumously-published memoir.</p>
<p>While Prince Andrew has always strenuously denied abusing Giuffre, fresh questions have been asked in recent days about how he is able to fund his lifestyle despite not being a working royal.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew, who gave up titles including the Duke of York last week, signed the lease agreement on his home in 2003 with his landlord, the Crown Estate, which operates as an independent property company.</p>
<p>The Grade II-listed Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate boasts a gardener&#x27;s cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew&#x27;s rent is described as a &quot;peppercorn&quot;, which means a small sum such as £1, which can be paid every year on a long lease, as part of a legal arrangement between a tenant and the landlord. Or in his case there was no payment at all.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not about making a profit but is a symbolic payment, in this case from Prince Andrew to the Crown Estate.</p>
<p>This ongoing arrangement poses a problem for the Royal Family: with Prince Andrew mired in scandal, it is a terrible look to have him living among them in Windsor in apparent splendour.</p>
<p>The lease document also show Prince Andrew has to keep paying for the upkeep of Royal Lodge, ensuring the exterior stonework is in good condition every five years and painting the interior every seven years.</p>
<p>He has to &quot;paint, paper, polish, decorate&quot; to keep the house in good condition and to keep the landscaped grounds and gardens in good order. Prince Andrew, as the tenant, also has to allow his landlords to inspect and make sure he is keeping to the terms of the lease.</p>
<p>Other details revealed in the lease include clauses specifying that no helicopters are able to land there, and no gambling is allowed on the premises.</p>
<p>Information separately published by the National Audit Office shows Prince Andrew had to pay for £5 million worth of repairs, £2.5 million for the option of buying out future rent and a further £1 million premium to the Crown Estate.</p>

<p>Warning: The following article contains details about suicide which some may find distressing</p>
<p>Cerys Lupton-Jones pauses between two doorways.</p>
<p>One door leads into a side room in the Manchester mental health unit where she&#x27;s a patient. The other leads into a toilet.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old had tried to end her life just 20 minutes earlier - but no staff are seen on the CCTV footage from inside the unit.</p>
<p>She hesitates for about 30 seconds, walking backwards and forwards. Then she enters the toilet and shuts the door.</p>
<p>The next time she is seen on the footage, doctors and nurses are fighting to resuscitate her.</p>
<p>Cerys dies five days later, on 18 May 2022.</p>
<p>A coroner has concluded that some of the care Cerys was given at Park House, which was run by the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, was a &quot;shambles&quot;.</p>
<p>Staff were meant to be checking on her every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>But the last recorded observation - at 15:00 - had been falsified, saying she had been seen in a corridor. CCTV shows at that point, Cerys was already in the toilet where she would fatally harm herself.</p>
<p>A staff member who was supposed to be looking after her has now admitted to falsifying these records.</p>
<p>Zak Golombeck, coroner for Manchester, said that if someone had stayed with her after the earlier attempt to take her life, what followed may never have happened. He said neglect was likely to have contributed to her death.</p>
<p>Campaigners are calling for an inquiry into the number of deaths at the mental health trust and believe the services are in crisis.</p>
<p>Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust said it &quot;failed her that day, and we are so very sorry that we did not do more&quot;.</p>
<p>Cerys&#x27;s parents, Rebecca Lupton and Dave Jones, describe their daughter as a loving young woman who would do anything for her friends. She was studying to be a nurse and was months away from completing her degree, with a job lined up.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Boris Johnson left the Covid Inquiry in a hurry - he&#x27;ll be pleased not to come back</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6nennz0nyo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_a95f66054d6d.jpg'></p>
<p>Papers in hand, Boris Johnson arrived at the Covid Inquiry before the sun came up.</p>
<p>He was there to answer questions on decisions he made during the pandemic that directly impacted children.</p>
<p>School attendance, behaviour, screen time, speech and language - we now know the pandemic had an enduring effect on all of these issues for children.</p>
<p>Demand for speech and language support increased markedly after the pandemic. The number of children who are persistently absent from school is still stubbornly high. And school suspensions and exclusions have hit record levels.</p>
<p>Each of these issues can be traced back to a part of the pandemic which has been central to this session of the inquiry: the closure of schools.</p>
<p>The decision to shut schools was one described by Boris Johnson on Tuesday as a &quot;personal horror&quot; for him, a &quot;nightmare idea&quot;, but one which he also said seemed like the only option at the time.</p>
<p>We know that, in March 2020, the government was still maintaining an almost total focus on efforts to keep schools open.</p>
<p>But last week the former education secretary Gavin Williamson told the inquiry ministers should have &quot;bitten the bullet&quot; and done more to prepare for school closures.</p>
<p>We heard in earlier evidence given to the inquiry that there wasn&#x27;t even a plan for the closure of schools until the day before it was announced on 18 March 2020.</p>
<p>This was described as an &quot;extraordinary dereliction of duty&quot; in the evidence of Sir Jon Coles, chief executive of the United Learning trust.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, the former PM pushed back on that claim.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the sequence from February onwards, it&#x27;s clear that Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) is talking about the possibility, the Cabinet is discussing it in March. Certainly I remember the subject coming up repeatedly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It is right to say Sage had referenced the prospect of &quot;mass school closures&quot; in February 2020.</p>
<p>But the top civil servant at the Department for Education (DfE) at the time, Jonathan Slater, wrote in his evidence submitted to the inquiry that &quot;DfE&#x27;s contingency plans were premised on the assumption that schools (and other education settings) would remain open&quot;.</p>
<p>And Williamson told the inquiry last week that his ability to plan for closures was impeded by Downing Street.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Gaza ceasefire deal going better than expected, Vance says</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9k2dj37wqo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_1f3114836e67.jpg'></p>
<p>The implementation of a Gaza ceasefire agreement is &quot;going better than expected&quot; and the truce can hold, US Vice-President JD Vance has said during a visit to Israel.</p>
<p>Vance also warned that &quot;if Hamas does not co-operate, it will be obliterated&quot;, while refusing to give a deadline for when the Palestinian group must disarm - a part of US proposals yet to be agreed.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump, who brokered the ceasefire deal earlier this month, said America&#x27;s &quot;great allies&quot; in the Middle East would be ready to &quot;go into Gaza with a heavy force and &#x27;straighten out Hamas&#x27; if Hamas continues to act badly&quot;.</p>
<p>Vance&#x27;s visits come after a flare-up of violence on Sunday that threatened to derail the 12-day-old truce.</p>
<p>Israel said a Hamas attack killed two soldiers, triggering Israeli air strikes which killed dozens of Palestinians.</p>
<p>Trump wrote on social media that &quot;there is still hope that Hamas will do what is right&quot;, adding: &quot;If they do not, an end to Hamas will be FAST, FURIOUS, &amp; BRUTAL!&quot;</p>
<p>Vance is expected to push Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to start negotiations on long-term issues for a permanent end to the war with Hamas during his visit.</p>
<p>The vice-president praised Israel for being &quot;remarkably helpful&quot; in moving towards the deal&#x27;s main goals, but said that a lot of hard work remained ahead to secure further steps.</p>
<p>The two special US envoys who helped negotiate the ceasefire deal, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, appeared alongside Vance at a news briefing in southern Israel.</p>
<p>Witkoff and Kushner held talks with Netanyahu after arriving in Israel on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump is said to have dispatched his deputy and envoys to Israel to keep up the momentum and push for the start of talks on the second critical phase of his 20-point Gaza peace plan.</p>
<p>It would involve setting up an interim government in the Palestinian territory, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.</p>
<p>Israel has previously said it would not join such talks until Hamas has returned all the deceased hostages it has been holding.</p>
<p>Vance, Witkoff and Kushner are also attempting to ensure the ceasefire deal, which is based on the first phase of the peace plan, does not collapse first.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Stolen Louvre jewellery worth £76m, prosecutor says</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9722wlmj7o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_557c94ba03a1.jpg'></p>
<p>Jewellery stolen from the Louvre in Paris in a daring daylight robbery has been valued at 88 million euros (£76m; $102m), a French public prosecutor has said, citing the museum&#x27;s curator.</p>
<p>Laure Beccuau told RTL radio the sum was &quot;extraordinary&quot; but said the greater loss was to France&#x27;s historical heritage. Crown jewels and pieces gifted by two Napoleons to their wives were among the items taken.</p>
<p>With the thieves having not been caught more than two days on from the heist, experts fear the jewellery will already be long gone.</p>
<p>Ms Beccuau said she hoped announcing the estimated worth of the jewellery would make the robbers think twice and not destroy them.</p>
<p>She added the thieves would not pocket the full windfall if they had &quot;the very bad idea of melting down these jewels&quot;.</p>
<p>The items taken, previously described as having inestimable worth, include a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife, a tiara worn by Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, and several pieces previously owned by Queen Marie-Amelie.</p>
<p>Investigators found a damaged crown that used to belong to Empress Eugenie on the thieves&#x27; escape route - apparently having been dropped as they departed in haste.</p>
<p>Four masked thieves used a truck equipped with a mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d&#x27;Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.</p>
<p>Two of them cut through a glass window on the first floor using a battery-powered disc cutter and entered the museum. They then threatened the guards inside, who evacuated the building.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron described the robbery as an attack on France&#x27;s heritage.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said security protocols had &quot;failed&quot;, lamenting that the thieves being able to drive a modified truck up to the museum had left France with a &quot;terrible image&quot;.</p>
<p>Authorities believe they are chasing a team of professionals, given how quick and organised they were.</p>
<p>Experts in art recovery previously told the BBC investigators had just one or two days to track down the items before they could be considered gone for good.</p>
<p>It is most likely they have been broken down into precious metals and gems, smuggled out of the country and sold for a fraction of their worth, other experts have said.</p>
<p>A 23-year-old construction worked has been killed after a tornado tore through Val-d&#x27;Ois, north of Paris, on Monday, toppling three construction cranes.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>British grandmother on Bali death row to return to UK after drug smuggling conviction</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9jln834wo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_e3d71754ea72.jpg'></p>
<p>A British grandmother who has spent more than a decade on death row in Indonesia after being convicted of drug smuggling can return to the UK, the Indonesian government has said.</p>
<p>Lindsay Sandiford, 69, was sentenced to death on the island of Bali in 2013 after nearly five kilos of cocaine with a street value of £1.6m were found in her suitcase when she arrived on a flight from Thailand in 2012.</p>
<p>An agreement between the Indonesian and British governments, announced on Tuesday, will allow her to return to the UK in about two weeks alongside British national Shahab Shahabadi.</p>
<p>Sandiford, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, had faced the threat of execution by firing squad during her sentence in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Shahabadi, 35, had been serving a life sentence after being convicted of drug smuggling and both British prisoners are said to have been suffering from health problems.</p>
<p>The Indonesian minister for law and human rights, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, said he had signed a deal with British foreign secretary Yvette Cooper for the transfer of the pair.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed to grant the transfers of the prisoners to the UK. The agreement has been signed,&quot; Mr Yusril told reporters at a press conference in capital Jakarta earlier.</p>
<p>They will be handed over after the technical details of the transfer are agreed, which the minister said could take &quot;around two weeks&quot; to organise.</p>
<p>Speaking at the press conference, Mr Yusril said both prisoners are &quot;currently facing problems.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The first one, Sandiford, is in poor health and has been examined by our doctors as well as by a doctor from the British consulate in Bali. She is seriously ill.</p>
<p>&quot;The second, Shahab Shahabadi, although still young at 35 and serving a life sentence, is suffering from several serious health issues, particularly mental health disorders.&quot;</p>
<p>Indonesia and the UK do not have a formal prisoner transfer arrangement; normally these require that repatriated prisoners serve out their terms in their home countries.</p>
<p>Sandiford was arrested at a time when the Indonesian authorities were imposing tougher penalties on drug smugglers and in 2015 two Australian men were executed after being convicted of smuggling heroin.</p>
<p>Jennifer Fleetwood, a criminologist at the University of London, was part of Sandiford&#x27;s appeal team in the initial case 12 years ago. She said it was good that the grandmother would be returning to the UK.</p>
<p>She said: &quot;To undertake a prison sentence with the threat of execution, I can&#x27;t fathom how difficult that would be.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Weather warnings issued as potential named storm forecast to affect the UK</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/cly9rlzy0vro?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_a391448295f7.jpg'></p>
<p>This severe weather come as a deepening area of low pressure heads across southern England that has the potential to be a named storm.</p>
<p>However, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), MÃ©tÃ©o France or the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium may decide to name it.</p>
<p>Heavy rain will spread in across southern England late on Wednesday, spreading north-east and likely to persist right through until late Thursday.</p>
<p>Rainfall totals by early Thursday morning could be widely 20-30mm (around 1in), and for some places 30-50mm (up to 2in).</p>
<p>There is a small chance a few places could exceed this, most likely over Devon and Cornwall and more generally in eastern England.</p>
<p>Localised flooding and some transport disruption is possible.</p>
<p>A separate wind warning has also been issued for eastern England from 09:00 Thursday until 23:59 BST.</p>
<p>Very strong north-westerly winds gusting to 45-55mph (70-90km/h) in both areas are possible, while locally 65mph (105km/h) on the east coast is also possible.</p>
<p>While there is still some uncertainty on the intensity of this weather system, the Met Office warns that there is potential for gusts up to 75mph (120km/h) for a small period of time later on Thursday morning and into the afternoon.</p>
<p>These wind speeds have the potential to topple trees or their branches, cause travel disruption and even bring power cuts.</p>
<p>Different meteorological agencies collaborate to name storms with their own list of names</p>
<p>With much stronger winds expected in northern France or Belgium on Thursday, impacts there could be much more severe.</p>
<p>In this instance, MÃ©tÃ©o France or the Royal Meteorological Institute in Belgium could name it Storm Benjamin.</p>
<p>Benjamin is second on the list of names in the south-western Europe meteorological group consisting of Portugal, Spain, Luxembourg, France and Belgium.</p>
<p>However, if the Netherlands meteorological agency decides that impacts there will be more severe, it may wish to name it first.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Ukrainian city in total blackout after &#x27;massive&#x27; Russian assault</h2>
<p><em>BBC News - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8vrxjdd5go?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_84801ec6d71b.jpg'></p>
<p>The Ukrainian city of Chernihiv is in total blackout following what the authorities describe as a &quot;massive&quot; assault by Russian missiles and drones, with hundreds of thousands of people affected.</p>
<p>Across the wider Chernihiv region, four people are reported to have been killed as residential neighbourhoods were struck in the town of Novhorod-Siverskyi.</p>
<p>Ten others were injured, including a 10-year-old girl.</p>
<p>The country&#x27;s most northerly region is the latest to be hit in an intensifying series of attacks on civilian infrastructure as Russia targets energy supplies, the rail network, homes and businesses in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>&quot;I personally heard the drones flying overhead,&quot; 55-year-old Oleksandr Babich said.</p>
<p>The Chernihiv city resident spoke in matter-of-fact terms about a night filled with the low whine of Iranian-designed Shahed drones, a sound now being increasingly heard far from the war&#x27;s front lines.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, our region is very close to our scheming neighbour,&quot; he said, adding an expletive for good measure.</p>
<p>The Chernihiv region shares a border with both Russia and Belarus, giving the air defences here less time to react to any incoming attacks.</p>
<p>In a raid involving more than 100 Shahed drones - each of which carry a 50kg warhead - and six ballistic missiles, the direct strikes on Chernihiv&#x27;s electricity generating facilities left the whole city without power, as well as large parts of the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Andriy Podorvan, the deputy head of the Chernihiv Regional Military Administration, told the BBC that it was part of a pattern across much of the country, with things getting much worse in recent months.</p>
<p>&quot;For around half a year we have been experiencing targeted strikes on the energy infrastructure in our region,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of attacks has significantly increased over the last two months.&quot;</p>
<p>When I asked him if he believed that any of the targets were of military value - Moscow&#x27;s usual justification for these sorts of attacks - he pointed out that Russia has even been targeting petrol stations.</p>
<p>&quot;I can only see strikes on civilian infrastructure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The attack on the electricity grid has also meant the loss of power to water pumping stations, seriously impacting supplies. Residents have been told to stock up on bottled water or are having to rely on emergency deliveries.</p>

<p><em>BBC Entertainment - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rjnqvv5qqo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_6d8b34f0082f.jpg'></p>
<p>British designer Grace Wales Bonner has been named as the new creative director of menswear for French fashion house Hermès.</p>
<p>The appointment means Wales Bonner, a 35-year-old Londoner, is now the first black woman to lead design at a major fashion house, according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>In a statement, Wales Bonner said she was &quot;deeply honoured to be entrusted with the role&quot;.</p>
<p>She replaces Véronique Nichanian, who has been the company&#x27;s artistic director of menswear division for 37 years.</p>
<p>Her final collection for the brand will be shown in Paris in January, while Wales Bonner&#x27;s first collection will launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In her statement, Wales Bonner said: &quot;It is a dream realised to embark on this new chapter, following in a lineage of inspired craftspeople and designers.&quot;</p>
<p>She also thanked the company&#x27;s bosses &quot;for the opportunity to bring my vision to this magical house&quot;.</p>
<p>Reporting the news on Tuesday, Vogue said: &quot;While industry insiders were betting on a promotion from within, Hermès went for a renowned talent.&quot;</p>
<p>Wales Bonner, who was born in London to an English mother and Jamaican father, founded her own label in 2014, not long after graduating from London&#x27;s Central Saint Martins College of Art.</p>
<p>According to Vogue, Wales Bonner will continue her namesake brand alongside her new Hermès role.</p>
<p>She dressed F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, musician FKA Twigs, and actor Jeff Goldblum for this year&#x27;s Met Gala and has made T-shirts with musician Solange Knowles, younger sister of Beyoncé.</p>
<p>Wales Bonner has also curated an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and hosted musical performances at London&#x27;s Serpentine Galleries.</p>
<p>She has had a long-standing collaboration with Adidas and was made a MBE in 2022 for services to fashion.</p>
<p>Pierre-Alexis Dumas, general artistic director of Hermès, said: &quot;I am really pleased to welcome Grace to the Hermès artistic director family.</p>
<p>&quot;Her take on contemporary fashion, craft and culture will contribute to shaping Hermès men&#x27;s style, melding the house&#x27;s heritage with a confident look on the now.</p>

<p>Bad Boy Chiller Crew forgive anyone who forgot about them.</p>
<p>The trio&#x27;s brand of Bradford bassline earned them a UK top 10 single with BMW in 2022.</p>
<p>And their first album, Disrespectful, would have made number one if Ed Sheeran&#x27;s = (Equals) hadn&#x27;t got in its way.</p>
<p>By 2023 Gareth &quot;GK&quot; Kelly, Kane Welsh and Sam &quot;Clive&quot; Robinson were riding high, nominated for group of the year at the Brits alongside The 1975 and Arctic Monkeys.</p>
<p>Just as they were building momentum, they tell BBC Newsbeat, they were forced to hit pause when a legal dispute erupted with record label House Anxiety.</p>
<p>Unable to release new tracks, they swapped making music for combing through contracts. Kane says it was like &quot;jogging on the spot&quot;.</p>
<p>In July, a judge confirmed that a deal between the band and the record label had expired.</p>
<p>The group admit they&#x27;d considered going their separate ways during their hiatus.</p>
<p>&quot;I was ready to give it up,&quot; GK tells Newsbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn&#x27;t earn a living. What we had left got thrown into solicitor and court fees.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the worst time of our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Kane says it&#x27;s a relief to share music they&#x27;ve had ready and waiting on hard drives for months.</p>
<p>&quot;We were putting all this work and effort in, eight hours a day, making music that we couldn&#x27;t even release,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>GK adds: &quot;But what we&#x27;re trying to do is bring the old sound back.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now</h2>
<p><em>BBC Entertainment - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4nr1415wo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_47f8cf2e61d1.jpg'></p>
<p>The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair&#x27;s tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.</p>
<p>Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears&#x27;s allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.</p>
<p>Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.</p>
<p>Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book&#x27;s release by publisher Listenin.</p>
<p>He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.</p>
<p>When they were teenagers, the couple&#x27;s sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. &quot;They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - &#x27;Oh, you&#x27;re awake?&#x27; - with a knife in her hand,&quot; he writes. &quot;Then she&#x27;d turn around and pad off without explanation.&quot;</p>
<p>Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: &quot;The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it&#x27;s racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we&#x27;re getting close to the 11th hour.&quot;</p>
<p>He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears&#x27;s life were controlled by others for years, and described it as a &quot;lifeline&quot; in its early days.</p>
<p>He claims Spears saw the events in her life &quot;through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one&quot;, but that she &quot;needed help&quot; and was &quot;in no state to responsibly manage her own affairs&quot;.</p>
<p>Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could &quot;never fully get behind it&quot;.</p>
<p>The pair got together in the summer of 2004, as Spears&#x27;s initial commercial peak started to wane.</p>
<p>They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.</p>
<p>Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.</p>
<p>The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.</p>
<p>In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Colman Domingo cast as cowardly Lion in upcoming Wicked sequel</h2>
<p><em>BBC Entertainment - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5e3p23dzvo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_a066c94019d6.jpg'></p>
<p>American actor and playwright Colman Domingo has been cast as the Cowardly Lion in the upcoming Wicked: For Good film, putting to rest a weekend of internet speculation on who would play the role.</p>
<p>Jon M Chu, the director for the highly-anticipated sequel film adaptation for the hit Broadway musical, teased the news on Thursday by saying a major Hollywood star will voice the part.</p>
<p>Domingo joins an already star-studded cast that includes Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba.</p>
<p>The film also stars Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum.</p>
<p>Chu told entertainment news outlet Deadline that he approached Domingo for the role of the Cowardly Lion on Instagram.</p>
<p>&quot;I was like, &#x27;It&#x27;s not a ton of lines, but maybe you have a little time. I know you&#x27;re busy. I&#x27;ll come to you,&#x27;&quot; Chu said, according to Deadline. Domingo responded &quot;Why the f--- not. Let&#x27;s go,&quot; he recalled.</p>
<p>The Broadway superstar has been nominated twice for an Academy Award, and has won a Primetime Emmy Award. He was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2024 by Time Magazine.</p>
<p>Buzz has been growing around the sequel Wicked: For Good since the first film was released in November 2024. The first full-length trailer for the sequel was unveiled in June.</p>
<p>Elphaba is now an enemy of the state of Oz, while Glinda has become a public figure controlled by the Wizard, who is played by Goldblum.</p>
<p>The film&#x27;s trailer also teases the arrival of Dorothy - seen walking down the yellow brick road with her friends - suggesting the character might have a bigger role in the films than in the musical. It&#x27;s still unclear who might be cast to play the character.</p>
<p>The films have been adapted from the hugely successful Broadway and West End musical, which itself was based on Gregory Maguire&#x27;s 1995 novel.</p>
<p>The two movies were shot simultaneously at Sky Studios Elstree in the United Kingdon between December 2022 and January 2024, with production interrupted mid-way through by the Hollywood actors&#x27; strike.</p>
<p>Wicked was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations - winning two for best costume and production design.</p>
<p>The sequel movie is set to be released almost a year-to-the-date of its predecessor on 21 November.</p>
<p>Sabrina Carpenter was also among the award winners and performers on the night in New York.</p>

<p><em>BBC Entertainment - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15pz8vpjp9o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_83b13460b82a.jpg'></p>
<p>US chess grandmaster and popular YouTube chess commentator Daniel Naroditsky has died aged 29.</p>
<p>The chess player&#x27;s family announced his &quot;unexpected&quot; death in a statement released by his club, the Charlotte Chess Center, on Monday. No cause of death was given.</p>
<p>The statement described him as a &quot;cherished member of the chess community, admired and respected by fans and players around the world&quot;.</p>
<p>Naroditsky was famous for his chess YouTube channel, which featured video tutorials and livestreams against competitors, and inspired hundreds of thousands of people across the world to play the game.</p>
<p>Naroditsky&#x27;s channel had nearly 500,000 subscribers, while his Twitch stream drummed up 340,000 followers.</p>
<p>Fans praised his insight and passion, casually referring to him as &quot;Danya&quot;.</p>
<p>He played a &quot;pivotal role in popularising chess content online&quot;, the International Chess Federation said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a massive loss for the world of chess,&quot; chess world number two, Hikaru Nakamura, said in a social media post.</p>
<p>Nakamura - a close friend of Naroditsky - told the BBC &quot;he inspired hundreds of thousands of people to play chess - a lot of people loved his videos&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;When it came to making chess content to help beginners, his was the best,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have played more than a thousand games of chess with Daniel,&quot; Nakamura added. &quot;Chess is a very cut-throat world and emotions run high, but Daniel was always calm.&quot;</p>
<p>The online content creation &quot;wasn&#x27;t about money for him&quot;, Nakamura said. &quot;He had a true passion for the game.&quot;</p>
<p>Naroditsky first took an interest in chess at the age of six, when his older brother Alan asked him to help entertain a group of children at a birthday party.</p>

<p>A security guard jailed for plotting to kidnap, rape and murder TV presenter Holly Willoughby has failed in appealing against his sentence.</p>
<p>Gavin Plumb is serving life with a minimum term of 16 years after being convicted of soliciting murder and inciting rape and kidnap of the former This Morning host in July 2024.</p>
<p>Police found bottles of chloroform and a &quot;kidnap kit&quot; complete with cable ties, a ball gag and rope when they raided the 38-year-old&#x27;s flat in Harlow, Essex.</p>
<p>Judges at the Court of Appeal ruled earlier that Plumb intended harm &quot;of the gravest and highest possible kind&quot; and his sentence was appropriate.</p>
<p>Sasha Wass KC, for Plumb, argued there was &quot;no suggestion of lasting psychological harm&quot; suffered by the victim, who has also presented I&#x27;m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
<p>But dismissing the appeal, Lord Justice Edis, sitting with Mr Justice Martin Spencer and Ms Justice Norton, said they concluded it was &quot;ultimately unpersuasive&quot;.</p>
<p>The judge said Willoughby&#x27;s death was &quot;specifically contemplated and intended&quot; by Plumb.</p>
<p>Jurors in Plumb&#x27;s trial at Chelmsford Crown Court heard his &quot;ultimate fantasy&quot; was to ambush Ms Willoughby at her home and bring sexualised violence against her at a &quot;dungeon&quot;-type room.</p>
<p>Plumb searched online for &quot;how to meet people who plan to kidnap celebs&quot; and messages he sent suggested he would murder the victim and put her &quot;into a lake at night&quot;.</p>
<p>Plumb argued from the witness box during his trial that his comments were just online chat and fantasy, but admitted they were &quot;dark&quot;.</p>
<p>Sentencing Plumb, Mr Justice Murray described some of his plans as &quot;particularly sadistic, brutal and degrading&quot;, and said he had &quot;no doubt that this was all considerably more than a fantasy&quot;.</p>
<p>After the jury delivered its verdicts, Ms Willoughby said in a statement: &quot;As women we should not be made to feel unsafe going about our daily lives and in our own homes.&quot;</p>
<p>Essex Police discovered a &quot;kidnap kit&quot; consisting of hand and ankle shackles, rope, 400 metal cable ties and bottles of chloroform.</p>
<p>Plumb did not attend his appeal hearing either in person or remotely from prison.</p>
<p>His barrister argued he was serving a sentence that was &quot;far too long and it properly could have been reduced considerably&quot;.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Stefan Dennis withdraws from Strictly Come Dancing due to injury</h2>
<p><em>BBC Entertainment - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl2k475x02o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>

<p>Actor and Neighbours star Stefan Dennis has withdrawn from Strictly Come Dancing due to injury.</p>
<p>&quot;I was told that on Saturday I had torn my calf so significantly that I am now forced to withdraw from the show,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Australian was a contestant in the BBC dance show, partnered with professional Dianne Buswell.</p>
<p>&quot;I owe both the Strictly Family and Dianne a massive debt of gratitude for giving me the opportunity to fulfil my dream of being able to dance with my wife. (When my leg is better),&quot; the 66-year-old added.</p>
<p>The actor had only just returned to the show, after missing his week three performance due to an illness.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a little bit of a turn, a little bit of an episode with vertigo,&quot; he said during an appearance on companion programme Strictly: It Takes Two.</p>
<p>&quot;But it was all OK, I made myself right again with the help of some good people at the hospital,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dennis&#x27;s return, in week four of the show on Saturday, saw him and Buswell secure their highest score of the series - performing a Charleston to the song Dance Monkey by Australian musician Tones and I.</p>
<p>Strictly judge Shirley Ballas said Dennis had come &quot;back with a bang&quot;, and that he had pushed his limits with a difficult routine.</p>
<p>The pair are scheduled to be interviewed on Strictly: It Takes Two on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dennis is best known for playing Paul Robinson in Neighbours, the longest-running character in Australian television history.</p>
<p>Following his first appearance in 1985, he went on to feature in 6,000 episodes across four decades.</p>
<p>His partner Buswell made history this Strictly series - becoming the first professional dancer to compete on the show while pregnant.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m still doing everything I did before,&quot; she said ahead of the beginning of the series.</p>
<p>Speaking on her podcast Winning Isn&#x27;t Everything, she added: &quot;Obviously with lifts there&#x27;s going to be a bit more caution. But my doctor has said everything is normal.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Presenter&#x27;s Toto adventure book becomes stage play</h2>
<p><em>BBC Entertainment - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04gzp3nng3o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>original</a></em></p>

<p>TV and radio presenter Dermot O&#x27;Leary says he is &quot;over the moon&quot; that the first in his successful six-part children&#x27;s book series is to become a stage musical.</p>
<p>O&#x27;Leary based his Toto the Ninja Cat stories on his real pet, a blind moggy he adopted in Italy, which he said showed &quot;incredible reactions&quot;.</p>
<p>The first in the series, Toto The Ninja Cat And The Great Snake Escape, has been adapted for the stage and will tour England next year, starting in the star&#x27;s home city of Colchester.</p>
<p>&quot;Toto is currently fast asleep, blissfully unaware of all the attention, but speaking on her behalf, she&#x27;ll be thrilled to bits that her adventures are about to come to life,&quot; the 52-year-old told BBC Breakfast.</p>
<p>The story follows Toto, a cat that is completely blind but uses ninja skills which aid her in her adventures with her brother Silver.</p>
<p>&quot;I turned her into a member of the Ancient Order of Ninja Cats,&quot; O&#x27;Leary added, &quot;and she works for Larry, the Downing Street cat.</p>
<p>&quot;I grew up going to the Mercury Theatre, to see panto and plays. I can&#x27;t wait to see what they&#x27;ve done with it.&quot;</p>
<p>The production, adapted from page to stage by Samantha Lane, artistic director of Little Angel Theatre, and musician Barb Jungr, will be filled with original music and puppetry.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m over the moon to see my book brought to life through puppetry,&quot; O&#x27;Leary added.</p>
<p>Illustrator Nick East said: &quot;Working with Dermot on the Toto The Ninja Cat series has been an utter delight, and I&#x27;m thrilled that the amazing Little Angel team are now giving our fearless feline a whole new adventure in puppet form.&quot;</p>
<p>The stage show will also play London&#x27;s Little Angel Theatre, as well as Southampton, Bristol, Birmingham, Weymouth and Guildford.</p>
<p>O&#x27;Leary, who presents on ITV&#x27;s This Morning and BBC Radio 2, is the author of a number of children&#x27;s books, including Spy Fox And Agent Feathers and Wings Of Glory.</p>
