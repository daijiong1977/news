            <div class="article-content">In our news wrap Monday, the Louvre remained closed as investigators hunt for those responsible for a heist of some of France's most precious jewels, Amazon's cloud computing service says a problem with its domain name system is responsible for a global outage and the Supreme Court will hear a Second Amendment challenge involving a law that bans regular drug users from having a gun.

We start the day's other headlines in Paris.

The Louvre remained closed today as investigators hunt for those responsible for yesterday's daylight heist of some of that nation's most precious jewels. Officials say the daring break-in lasted less than eight minutes. And, in the hours since, the museum has faced sharp criticism over its security.

Sam Holder of Independent Television News reports from the scene in Paris.

It's the world's most visited museum. But, for now, the crowds are outside the Louvre, the star attraction a boarded-up window, the heart of a heist so audacious, it could be from a blockbuster.

On Sunday morning, when the museum was open and filled with visitors, the calls began to evacuate, most unaware that a heist of historic proportions was under way, thieves smashing through two display cabinets to snatch priceless royal jewels.

Amongst the stolen haul, this emerald necklace worn by Napoleon Bonaparte's wife, this tiara resplendent with pearls and this brooch dripping in diamonds. In total, eight items are missing.

Well, it's like the stealing of the crown jewels. It's the kings, the queens of France wore these things. Paris is a bit in shock.

The robbery began at 9:30 a.m., the target, the Gallery of Apollo. The four thieves used a van with a mechanical ladder to reach the window. Two cut through the glass with a disc cutter and entered. The theft unfolded just 250 meters from the Mona Lisa.

Julian Radcliffe, Founder, Art Loss Register:

They would have done a reconnaissance.They'd have known the height, the distance. They'd have rehearsed using that equipment somewhere else. That may well give a lead to the police.

The apparent security failings have led to a furious response in France.

Gerald Darmanin, French Justice Minister (through interpreter):

I know that it's impossible to completely secure all locations, but what is certain is that we have failed, since it is possible to set up a hoist in the middle of a Paris street, lift people up in a matter of minutes to steal priceless jewelry and give France a terrible image.

Only one piece has been found. The thieves dropped this crown during their escape, which alone features more than 1,000 diamonds. The pieces may be priceless, but the stones can fetch millions.</div>

Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused President Trump of murdering a Colombian fisherman in one of those strikes. Trump called Petro an "illegal drug dealer." Amna Nawaz discussed more with Ivan Duque, the president of Colombia from 2018 to 2022.

Colombia recalled its ambassador to the United States today amid rising tensions between the two countries after U.S. military strikes took out what the Trump administration claimed were drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean.

But over the weekend, a very public spat broke out between the country's leaders, with Gustavo Petro of Colombia accusing President Trump of murdering a Colombian fisherman in one of those strikes and Trump calling Petro an illegal drug dealer.

Ivan Duque ]was the president of Colombia from 2018 to 2022, and he joins us tonight from Bogota, Colombia.

President Duque, welcome to the "News Hour." Thank you for joining us.

Ivan Duque, Former Colombian President:

Amna, thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be here with you.

So your successor, President Petro, has now accused U.S. President Trump of murder. He also says the U.S. is violating Colombian sovereignty with those strikes. Do you agree with those accusations?

Well, I think what Petro wants to do right now is try to use this tension in order to influence the election that we have in 2026, that's for sure.

And also he has done everything that he has been possible or capable of doing in order to dismantle and to make fragile a bilateral relationship that has lasted for more than 200 years and actually being Colombia recognized just few years ago as a major strategic ally of the United States, not permanent member of NATO, which is the highest standard that any Latin American country has ever enjoyed with the United States.

So I think it's reckless what Petro has been doing. And I think the fact is also that Colombia has been working with the United States in the Caribbean against narcotrafficking for many years with the Orion campaign. So I believe what the United States is doing against narcotrafficking, it's well done.

It's based on a legal legitimacy. And I think Petro is just trying to find an excuse in order to break a relationship that has been bipartisan, bicameral and historical.

To be clear, the U.S. now has some 10,000 troops in the Caribbean. They have dozens of military aircrafts and ships. President Petro is accusing President Trump of killing a Colombian national and without showing any evidence that this person was involved in any kind of illegal activity. Have you seen evidence of that?

Well, I don't think there's evidence that proves that right now, Amna, but I think also what is interesting to express is that, in the last decade, Colombia and the U.S. have worked jointly in interdiction, aerial interdiction and maritime interdiction.

And in those interdiction exercises, there have been usage of weapons if the vessels or the planes do not follow orders and do not proceed to be put under the custody of the judicial system or the military intervention. So the bombardments that we have seen are all based in the fight against narcotics in the Caribbean.</div>

            <div class="article-content">Republicans in North Carolina moved forward with a plan to redraw the state's congressional map and eliminate its only swing district. It's part of a GOP push to maintain control of Congress through maps that have the effect of diluting Black political power and diminishing the voting strength of communities of color. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

Republican lawmakers in North Carolina moved forward with a proposal today to redraw their state's congressional map in a way that would eliminate its only swing district.

The mid-decade redistricting is part of a nationwide push by President Trump and his Republican allies to help the GOP maintain control of Congress in next year's elections, often through maps that have the effect of diluting Black political power and diminishing the voting strength of communities of color.

Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court appeared willing to issue a ruling that could further that effort during arguments in a Louisiana redistricting case.

NAACP Legal Defense Fund president Janai Nelson argued the case before the court in defense of Louisiana voters, and she joins us now.

Janai Nelson, President and Director-Counsel, NAACP Legal Defense Fund: Thank you. Happy to be here.

So what was the main argument you presented before the court in defense of the existing Louisiana map that includes two majority-Black districts? What did you want the justices to understand about the stakes?

Well, I wanted the justices to understand that that map was remedying very flagrant violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and that, if for some reason, that map was not acceptable to them, that the proper recourse is to send it back to the lower courts, so that another map could be drawn that does remedy the racial discrimination that we proved in the case, and that what the court should not do is tinker with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, because it has been such a formidable protection and tool to advance our democracy.

And you just explained the many ways in which Black voters are often exploited or their votes are diluted for a variety of reasons, including sometimes partisan aims. And the Voting Rights Act, Section 2 in particular, is the only shield from that we can use with any expectation of real protection.

For the unfamiliar, what is Section 2 and what does it do?

So, Section 2 is part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It's a permanent provision of that act. And it basically says that there's no voting practice, procedure, qualification, anything having to do with voting that can abridge the right to vote, so deny it or dilute it or harm it in any way, minimize it, on account of race.

And, as we mentioned, North Carolina Republicans are moving forward with this plan to effectively oust one of the state's three Black members of Congress by carving up an area of Eastern North Carolina in this congressional map, and this district happens to have a large Black population.

So how does that square with what constitutes racial dilution under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act?

Well, it's pretty squarely a violation of the act, as far as I can tell. It is using Black voters as a means for gaining political power or partisan control.

And while the Supreme Court did say in another case, Rucho v. Common Cause, that it will not entertain any partisan gerrymandering claims, racial gerrymandering is still unlawful and it's still justiciable by the court, meaning that those claims are still viable before the court.</div>

In the Arctic tundra of Alaska, climate change is forcing an Alaskan Native village to relocate. Rising temperatures are melting the ice under the ground called permafrost. The melted ice then mixes with the soil, creating unstable land. The Yup'ik people call it Alaskan quicksand.

From Alaska, Amalia Huot-Marchand and a team from the Medill School of Journalism report.

Edna Chase, Resident of Nunapitchuk, Alaska: The houses, it's sinking. Every year, my floor falls six inches all around the house.

Edna Chase, 60 years old, lives in the Alaskan village of Nunapitchuk. She's been in this home for 53 years, but now, due to rising temperatures, the permafrost underground is melting. Her house is sinking in what they call Alaskan quicksand.

There's no more foundation. It's under the ground. I have got three floors, two underwater, and the top one can't dry. Sometimes, I have to have five fans going. Man, it stinks in here.

She has to pump the water from under her house every 15 minutes to keep it from flooding.

Seven hundred Yup'ik Natives call Nunapitchuk home. Water is a major threat to village infrastructure, but it's also a part of daily life. The village is divided into three islands by the Johnson River, where kids swim, people fish for subsistence, and the post office delivers packages by boat.

The melting permafrost affects every aspect of life here. The only way to get around is walking on boardwalks, which are in constant need of repair. Most infrastructure is severely damaged. According to village authorities, the town and surrounding area will be uninhabitable within 10 to 15 years.

So residents voted to relocate to higher ground in 2023.

Morris Alexie, Resident of Nunapitchuk, Alaska: We are on the brink now.

Morris Alexie is a Nunapitchuk resident leading the relocation efforts. He took us to the new location by boat. It's only three miles away, but at least 20 feet higher above sea level. The village bought this land four years ago, and the more firm, stable land should allow buildings to last for centuries.

It would be a relief, for this, as you can see, high and dry over here.

To move here, they need the support and financial assistance of the U.S. government. But bureaucratic hurdles have slowed this process.

With this new administration in the federal government, it seems like we were making some steps forward, and then this was like a step back again.</div>

            <div class="article-content">NPR's Tamara Keith and Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter join Geoff Bennett to discuss the latest political news, including the millions taking to the streets to protest President Trump's agenda, the government shutdown entering its third full week with no resolution, whether GOP redistricting efforts could help them win and the start of work on Trump's White House ballroom.

Millions of people took to the streets throughout the country this weekend to protest President Donald Trump's agenda as the government shutdown enters its third full week with no clear resolution.

For more, we're joined by our Politics Monday duo. That's Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter and Tamara Keith of NPR.

It's always great to see you both.

Tamara Keith, National Public Radio:

Amy Walter, The Cook Political Report:

So, some seven million people, according to the organizers, they protested, demonstrated across some 2,500 cities. The president dismissed this weekend's massive protests. You see the images there from this past weekend. He dismissed them as a joke, saying that the people involved were not representative of the country.

Take a listen to what he had to say.

Donald Trump, President of the United States: I think it's a joke. I looked at the people. They're not representative of this country. And, by the way, I'm not a king. I'm not a king. I have worked my ass off to make our country great. That's all it is. I'm not a king at all.

Congratulations. They didn't burn any buildings down. That's a big achievement for the left to have some kind of gathering where they don't have looting and riots and burn a building down.

Again, some seven million people, 2,500 cities. This clearly aggravated him a little bit.

Yes. And part of President Trump's power in this second term has come from an air of invincibility, of inevitability, of having power and being able to use it.

And what these demonstrators showed, mostly what they showed each other, is that they aren't alone and that there are people who actually do oppose the president. He has - by sort of saying, ah, this isn't a big deal and all of that, he is - and also putting out a video, an A.I.-altered - or not altered, an A.I.-created video of himself flying a fighter jet with a crown on his head, much like a king, dropping what looks like excrement on protesters, he's trying to downplay something that is real and is a part of America.

Obviously, it's not all of America. It's not his part of America. He has repeatedly, by - during the government shutdown, for instance, saying, I'm going to defund Democrat things and Democrat states, to use the phrasing that he has used, he is essentially saying he's president for a different America.

And, Amy, it's not at all surprising that the president would dismiss these protests.</div>
