## 🚀 Usage

### To View Emails

   open email_easy.html
   open email_mid.html
   open email_hard.html
   open email_CN.html
   ```

2. Or use a web server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8888
   # Then visit: http://localhost:8888/email_easy.html
   ```

### To Send Emails

1. Copy HTML content to email client
2. Or use email service API (Buttondown, SendGrid, etc.)
3. Images will load from server URL

### To Regenerate

1. **Update payloads**: `python3 combine_email_payloads.py`
2. **Generate level-specific HTML**: `python3 generate_level_html.py`
3. **Generate combined HTML**: `python3 generate_email_html.py`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Server Settings
- Port: `8000` (configured in `api_simple.py`)
- Domain: `http://localhost:8000` (update for production)
- Image path: `/api/images/`

### To Change Domain

Edit the payload generation scripts:

**generate_email_payload.py** (line 15):
```python
SERVER_DOMAIN = "https://yourdomain.com"  # Change here
```

**combine_email_payloads.py** (line 17):
```python
SERVER_DOMAIN = "https://yourdomain.com"  # Change here
```

Then regenerate payloads and HTML.
