All the world's discarded phones, bricked laptops, and other trashed electronics are collectively a treasure trove of rare earth elements (REEs). But separating out and recovering these increasingly sought-after materials is no easy task.

However, a team of researchers says it has developed a way of separating REEs from waste-magnets, in this case-that is relatively easy, uses less energy, and isn't nearly as...

Chances are you've encountered some version of the "Ebbinghaus illusion," in which a central circle appears to be smaller when encircled by larger circles and seems larger when surrounded by smaller circles. It's an example of context-dependent size perception. But is this unique to humans or are some animals susceptible as well?

His substance didn't actually cure anyone, but it was eventually widely used as a diagnostic skin test. Koch's successful failure is just one of the many colorful cases featured in Dead Ends!

Our hominid ancestors faced a Pleistocene world full of dangers-and apparently one of those dangers was lead poisoning.

Lead exposure sounds like a modern problem, at least if you define "modern" the way a paleoanthropologist might: a time that started a few thousand years ago with ancient Roman silver smelting and lead pipes. According to a recent study, however, lead is a much more ancient nemesis, one that predates ...
