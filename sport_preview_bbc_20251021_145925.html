<div class='article'><h2>Back to basics, winning back fans &amp; Clough&#x27;s dog - Dyche&#x27;s Forest return</h2>

<p>Sean Dyche has signed a deal with Nottingham Forest until summer 2027</p>
<p>New Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche wants his under-performing stars to reconnect with disillusioned supporters.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old became Forest&#x27;s third manager in six weeks when he replaced Ange Postecoglou on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Postecoglou was dismissed 39 days after he came in for the sacked Nuno Espirito Santo on 9 September.</p>
<p>Former Tottenham boss Postecoglou struggled to win over supporters, who chanted he would be &quot;sacked in the morning&quot; during a 3-2 Europa League defeat by Midtjylland last month.</p>
<p>Dyche came through the Forest academy in the 1980s, although he never made a first-team appearance, and is eager to unify the City Ground.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to get back on the front foot, in old football terminology, and hopefully give the crowd something to cheer about and reconnect,&quot; Dyche told BBC Radio Nottingham.</p>
<p>&quot;The Forest fans in my experience have been very fair down the years and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s far away from the team reconnecting. The first thing is performances, get them back on that winning edge they have shown.&quot;</p>
<p>Is Dyche the right man to repair Forest?</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest appoint Dyche as new manager</p>
<p>Inside Postecoglou&#x27;s 39 days to forget at Forest</p>
<p>Forest finished seventh in the Premier League last season under Nuno, their highest placing for 30 years, but they sit 18th and have not won since the opening day of this campaign.</p>
<p>They face Porto in the Europa League in Dyche&#x27;s first game on Thursday before travelling to Bournemouth on Sunday.</p>
<p>Forest have not kept a clean sheet for 20 games, since beating Manchester United in April. They will host United at the City Ground on 1 November.</p>
<p>&quot;The basics have always got to be in place,&quot; said Dyche.</p>

<p>How do you improve a stellar veteran team who have won back-to-back promotions, including a league-cup double featuring 30 wins from 32 games?</p>
<p>Recruit a raft of former professionals who have played at the highest level of club and international football as you target more silverware.</p>
<p>Manchester club Wythenshawe AFC, external have an amateur vets team with nine former Premier League players in their current squad.</p>
<p>BBC Sport takes a closer look at the Sunday league dream team.</p>
<p>Wythenshawe Vets Over-35s are based in south Manchester and play in the Cheshire Vets League Premier Division.</p>
<p>Their squad list this season boasts nine former Premier League players, with a combined 1,801 top-flight appearances.</p>
<p>The elite roster also contains 222 Premier League goals and 325 international caps.</p>
<p>They include Papiss Cisse, who scored 37 goals in 117 appearances for Newcastle United after joining for Â£9m from Bundesliga side Freiburg in January 2012.</p>
<p>Cisse made his debut for Wythenshawe in their last home game against reigning champions Collegiate Old Boys and scored all six goals in a 6-2 win - including a 32-minute first-half hat-trick.</p>
<p>Wythenshawe&#x27;s squad for this season also includes former pros such as England and Liverpool striker Emile Heskey, Hull and Burnley winger George Boyd, Everton striker Oumar Niasse, Wigan full-back Maynor Figueroa, Manchester City duo Stephen Ireland and Nedum Onuoha and Premier League title winners Joleon Lescott and Danny Drinkwater.</p>
<p>Collectively, the former top-flight players have won 15 major trophies and moved for combined transfer fees of about Â£123m.</p>
<p>Stephen Ireland won six Republic of Ireland caps, scoring four goals</p>
<p>Ireland began playing for the team during pre-season this summer through close friend and current Wythenshawe player Blake Norton, and the former Republic of Ireland midfielder then invited other ex-pros, who all play in a midweek nine-a-side game, to join in.</p>
<p>Former Senegal forward Niasse, who scored 12 goals in 65 Premier League games for Everton and still attends their home games, also made his debut against Collegiate OB - who are based in Liverpool and wear an Everton training kit as their strip.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Winning &amp; togetherness - Rohl sets out Rangers mission</h2>

<p>Danny Rohl has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Rangers</p>
<p>Danny Rohl delivered a simple message as he was introduced as Rangers head coach: &quot;We want to win.&quot;</p>
<p>The German, 36, has replaced Russell Martin, who left Ibrox after 17 games, only five of which were victories.</p>
<p>Rangers trail Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts by 13 points and defending champions Celtic by eight.</p>
<p>In the Europa League, Martin oversaw defeats in Rangers&#x27; opening two league phase fixtures.</p>
<p>&quot;We know where we are at the moment,&quot; said Rohl. &quot;We want to win, we need wins because we want to turn around the position at the moment. We are not happy.</p>
<p>&quot;I looked for a club to win titles and this club has everything for all these goals. It&#x27;s amazing to be part of here.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x27;Rohl jumps from Wednesday frying pan into Rangers furnace&#x27;</p>
<p>What awaits new Rangers manager Rohl?</p>
<p>&#x27;I see so much potential&#x27; - Rohl introduced as Rangers head coach</p>
<p>Rohl gave an insight into his tactical approach, with Rangers having struggled defensively this term and also been blunt in attack.</p>
<p>&quot;My focus is on my person, what I can bring to this football club,&quot; the former Sheffield Wednesday boss said. &quot;I see so much potential.</p>
<p>&quot;My football, what I want to see on the pitch is intensity, it&#x27;s sprinting, it&#x27;s a togetherness and a playing forward style because we want to create chances, we want to create goals.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to speed up our game. We want to attack the last line. If you do it again, we create more chances and we have more goals.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to defend as a group, as a unit much, much better with a lot of aggression in the duels.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>England&#x27;s chance to show Ashes scars have healed</h2>

<p>Heather Knight and Nat Sciver-Brunt were England&#x27;s leading run-scorers during the Ashes</p>
<p>England&#x27;s reunion with their greatest rivals Australia could not have come at a better time.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year England were humiliated in the Ashes. The 16-0 clean sweep was a non-contest, resulting in a complete overhaul of their leadership and a review - as is often prompted by an Ashes hammering, men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s.</p>
<p>Players have spoken about the scars left as a result, and while it is impossible to have a low-stakes England v Australia showdown, Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards have been presented with a golden opportunity to show that they have healed.</p>
<p>When they face each other in the group stage of the Women&#x27;s World Cup in Indore on Wednesday, England will be desperate to enact some revenge, but there is not a huge amount of pressure or expectation - and that could work in their favour.</p>
<p>Both teams are unbeaten, and both have already booked their place in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>The result of the game will play a big part in deciding who finishes top of the table, but other than that, it feels like its psychological consequences will be far more significant - particularly for England.</p>
<p>However, World Cup holders Australia have been dealt a hammer blow by losing their captain and the tournament&#x27;s leading run-scorer Alyssa Healy to a calf injury, which will force them to rejig their line-up with Georgia Voll likely to open, Tahlia McGrath to captain and Beth Mooney to keep wicket.</p>
<p>Australia have a title to defend, England have a point to prove.</p>
<p>If they give even the slightest hint that the Ashes drubbing is still lurking in their minds, Australia are ruthless and will pounce.</p>
<p>England through to semi-finals - who can join them?</p>
<p>England &#x27;got away with it&#x27; against Pakistan - Edwards</p>
<p>England beat India in thriller to seal Women&#x27;s World Cup semi-final spot</p>
<p>The fallout and scrutiny on England after the Ashes was so significant that it was never going to be a quick fix for Edwards, who was ushered in to replace Jon Lewis in the aftermath.</p>
<p>Even here in India and Sri Lanka, where they are unbeaten, there are still areas needed to improve considerably if they are to kick on past the semi-finals, most notably a fragile middle order which is relying heavily on Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Pakistan out after rain-hit defeat by South Africa</h2>

<p>South Africa knock Pakistan out of World Cup in rain-affected match</p>
<p>ICC Women&#x27;s World Cup, Colombo</p>
<p>South Africa 312-9 (40 overs): Wolvaardt 90 (82); Nashra 3-45</p>
<p>Pakistan 83-7 (20 overs): Sidra Nawaz 22* (33); Kapp 3-20</p>
<p>South Africa won by 150 runs (Duckworth-Lewis-Stern)</p>
<p>South Africa returned to the top of the table and eliminated Pakistan from the World Cup with a 150-run win on the DLS method in a rain-plagued match in Colombo.</p>
<p>It looked like the weather would wash out another match in the Sri Lankan capital, with rain halting play for nearly two and a half hours just two overs into South Africa&#x27;s innings and returning 10 overs into Pakistan&#x27;s chase.</p>
<p>However, South Africa were able to complete a 40-over innings, with three players scoring half-centuries and Nadine de Klerk blasting 41 (16) to propel the Proteas to 312-9.</p>
<p>Pakistan were then restricted to 83-7 chasing a rain-reduced 234 from 20 overs, down from their initial revised target of 306 in 40 overs and later 262 from 25 overs after multiple disruptions.</p>
<p>Bottom side Pakistan, who needed to win their final two group matches to keep their semi-final hopes alive, join Bangladesh in being eliminated with a game to spare.</p>
<p>Already qualified South Africa, meanwhile, move one point clear of Australia and England, who meet in Indore on Wednesday.</p>
<p>South Africa lost opener Tazmin Brits for her third duck of the tournament in the second over but came out swinging after the rain delay.</p>
<p>Laura Wolvaardt, top scoring with 90, and Sune Luus (61) combined for 118 for the second wicket to lay the foundations for an imposing total before late runs from Marizanne Kapp (68 not out) and De Klerk carried the Proteas beyond 300.</p>
<p>In reply, Ayabonga Khaka removed Muneeba Ali in the second over before Kapp struck three times in 10 deliveries to reduce Pakistan to 35-4 before the rain returned.</p>
<p>After a truncated two-over return, Pakistan were eventually tasked with scoring 186 runs from eight overs to complete the required 20 overs to constitute a match, and with South Africa running deliveries and turning down reviews, they beat both the weather and Pakistan to secure the two points.</p>
