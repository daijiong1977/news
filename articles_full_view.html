<p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance arrived in Israel on Tuesday to shore up the fragile U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, following a burst of deadly violence and questions over the plan for long-term peace.</p>
<p>Watch Vance speak in the player above.</p>
<p>Vance was meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials and is expected to stay in the region until Thursday. White House envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump&#x27;s son-in-law, arrived Monday and Vance met with them upon landing.</p>
<p>Vance was also expected to meet with families of hostages whose remains are still in Gaza and some of the living hostages released last week. Witkoff and Kushner met with nine of them on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hamas said it has recovered the remains of two more hostages and planned to hand them over Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The ceasefire took effect on Oct. 10. While it has been tested by Sunday&#x27;s fighting and mutual accusations of violations, both Israel and Hamas have said they are committed to the deal. Trump has made clear he wants it to succeed.</p>
<p>The head of Egypt&#x27;s intelligence agency, Maj. Gen. Hassan Rashad, traveled to Israel on Tuesday to meet with Netanyahu, Witkoff and others over the ceasefire&#x27;s implementation, according to Netanyahu&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>The meetings highlight the urgency of launching negotiations for the second phase of the U.S. plan, which must address issues such as the disarmament of Hamas and the governance of postwar Gaza. Hamas negotiators reiterated that the group is committed to ensuring the war &quot;ends once and for all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From the day we signed the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, we were determined and committed to seeing it through to the end,&quot; Hamas chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, who is in Cairo, told Egypt&#x27;s Al-Qahera News television late Monday.</p>
<p>Israel confirmed that Palestinian militants had released the body of Tal Haimi, who was killed in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. He was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. The 42-year-old was part of its emergency response team and had four children, including one born after the attack.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the ceasefire, Israel is waiting for Hamas to turn over the remains of 15 hostages. Thirteen others have been turned over.</p>
<p>Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Israel is releasing 15 Palestinian bodies for the remains of each dead hostage, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government. It said Israel had transferred another 15 on Tuesday, for a total of 165 since earlier this month.</p>

<h2>WATCH LIVE: Trump holds luncheon for Senate Republicans facing Democrats over budget shutdown</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday - not for urgent talks on how to end it but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.</p>
<p>Watch the Senate in the player above.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.</p>
<p>With both sides showing no signs of movement, it&#x27;s unclear how long the stalemate will last - even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the lunch meeting in the White House Rose Garden appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.</p>
<p>Asked about the message at lunch, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, second in Senate GOP leadership, told Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; on Tuesday that it will be, &quot;Republicans are united, and I expect the president to say, &#x27;Stand strong.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Senate Republican leader John Thune, of South Dakota said on Monday that he thinks Trump is ready to &quot;get involved on having the discussion&quot; about extending the subsidies. &quot;But I don&#x27;t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening.</p>
<p>Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.</p>
<p>And as the shutdown keeps future health costs in limbo for millions of Americans, most U.S. adults are worried about health care becoming more expensive, according to a new Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, as they make decisions about next year&#x27;s health coverage.</p>
<p>Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position remains the same: We want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,&quot; said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.</p>
<p>Schumer called the White House meeting a &quot;pep rally&quot; and said it was &quot;shameful&quot; that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.</p>
<p>Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.</p>
<p>Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn&#x27;t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, &quot;if not something on a much longer-term basis.&quot;</p>

<h2>U.S. appeals court says Trump can take command of Oregon National Guard troops, though deployment blocked for now</h2>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - An appeals court on Monday put on hold a lower-court ruling that kept President Donald Trump from taking command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. However, Trump is still barred from actually deploying those troops, at least for now.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders early this month - one that prohibited Trump from calling up the troops so he could send them to Portland, and another that prohibited him from sending any National Guard members to Oregon at all, after the president tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.</p>
<p>The Justice Department appealed the first order, and in a 2-1 ruling Monday, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the administration. The majority said the president was likely to succeed on his claim that he had the authority to federalize the troops based on a determination he was unable to enforce the laws without them.</p>
<p>However, Immergut&#x27;s second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed.</p>
<p>Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.</p>
<p>The administration has said that because the legal reasoning underpinning both temporary restraining orders was the same, the second one was also invalid, and the majority opinion also said the two TROs &quot;rise or fall together.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon after the ruling Monday, the Justice Department asked Immergut to immediately dissolve her second order, which would allow Trump to deploy troops to Portland. The Justice Department argued that it is not the role of the courts to second-guess the president&#x27;s determination about when to deploy troops.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision staying the first TRO is a significant change in law that plainly warrants dissolution of this Court&#x27;s second TRO,&quot; the administration&#x27;s lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat, said he would ask for a broader panel of the appeals to reconsider the decision.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#x27;s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,&quot; Rayfield said. &quot;We are on a dangerous path in America.&quot;</p>
<p>The Justice Department did not return an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>Trump&#x27;s efforts to deploy National Guard troops in Democratic-led cities have been mired in legal challenges. A judge in California ruled that his deployment of thousands of National Guard troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a longstanding law that generally prohibits the use of the military for civilian policing, and the administration on Friday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>Mostly small nightly protests, limited to a single block, have been occurring since June outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland. Larger crowds, including counterprotesters and live-streamers, have shown up at times, and federal agents have used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.</p>

<h2>How GOP-led redistricting efforts may disenfranchise Black voters</h2>

<p>Republicans in North Carolina moved forward with a plan to redraw the state&#x27;s congressional map and eliminate its only swing district. It&#x27;s part of a GOP push to maintain control of Congress through maps that have the effect of diluting Black political power and diminishing the voting strength of communities of color. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers in North Carolina moved forward with a proposal today to redraw their state&#x27;s congressional map in a way that would eliminate its only swing district.</p>
<p>The mid-decade redistricting is part of a nationwide push by President Trump and his Republican allies to help the GOP maintain control of Congress in next year&#x27;s elections, often through maps that have the effect of diluting Black political power and diminishing the voting strength of communities of color.</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court appeared willing to issue a ruling that could further that effort during arguments in a Louisiana redistricting case.</p>
<p>NAACP Legal Defense Fund president Janai Nelson argued the case before the court in defense of Louisiana voters, and she joins us now.</p>
<p>Janai Nelson, President and Director-Counsel, NAACP Legal Defense Fund: Thank you. Happy to be here.</p>
<p>So what was the main argument you presented before the court in defense of the existing Louisiana map that includes two majority-Black districts? What did you want the justices to understand about the stakes?</p>
<p>Well, I wanted the justices to understand that that map was remedying very flagrant violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and that, if for some reason, that map was not acceptable to them, that the proper recourse is to send it back to the lower courts, so that another map could be drawn that does remedy the racial discrimination that we proved in the case, and that what the court should not do is tinker with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, because it has been such a formidable protection and tool to advance our democracy.</p>
<p>And you just explained the many ways in which Black voters are often exploited or their votes are diluted for a variety of reasons, including sometimes partisan aims. And the Voting Rights Act, Section 2 in particular, is the only shield from that we can use with any expectation of real protection.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, what is Section 2 and what does it do?</p>
<p>So, Section 2 is part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It&#x27;s a permanent provision of that act. And it basically says that there&#x27;s no voting practice, procedure, qualification, anything having to do with voting that can abridge the right to vote, so deny it or dilute it or harm it in any way, minimize it, on account of race.</p>
<p>And, as we mentioned, North Carolina Republicans are moving forward with this plan to effectively oust one of the state&#x27;s three Black members of Congress by carving up an area of Eastern North Carolina in this congressional map, and this district happens to have a large Black population.</p>
<p>So how does that square with what constitutes racial dilution under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act?</p>
<p>Well, it&#x27;s pretty squarely a violation of the act, as far as I can tell. It is using Black voters as a means for gaining political power or partisan control.</p>
<p>And while the Supreme Court did say in another case, Rucho v. Common Cause, that it will not entertain any partisan gerrymandering claims, racial gerrymandering is still unlawful and it&#x27;s still justiciable by the court, meaning that those claims are still viable before the court.</p>

<h2>This simple neck measurement might reveal hidden heart risks</h2>
<p><em>Source: Science Daily | <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092844.htm">Original</a></em></p>
<div class="content">
<p>For decades, doctors have depended on indicators such as body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio to gauge a person&#x27;s risk for chronic disease. But researchers are now turning their attention to a different, often-overlooked measurement: neck circumference.</p>
<p>While a thick neck may suggest physical power, like that of athletes in contact sports, research indicates it could also be a marker of hidden health risks.</p>
<p>BMI calculates body fat by comparing weight to height, but it doesn&#x27;t always paint an accurate picture. A muscular athlete may register a high BMI without carrying excess fat. This is where measuring neck size can offer additional clues about what&#x27;s happening inside the body.</p>
<p>Studies have found that individuals with larger necks relative to their body size are more likely to develop serious health issues. The reason lies in fat distribution -- particularly in the upper body.</p>
<p>Fat stored around the upper torso releases fatty acids into the bloodstream, which can interfere with how the body regulates cholesterol, blood sugar, and heart rhythm. In effect, neck circumference acts as a visible indicator of visceral fat, the harmful kind that accumulates around internal organs.</p>
<p>The Link to Heart Disease and Other Conditions</p>
<p>Evidence connecting neck size to health outcomes is compelling. People with thicker necks show higher rates of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.</p>
<p>Atrial fibrillation is of particular concern because it causes irregular heartbeats and erratic blood flow, raising the risk of blood clots and stroke. Over time, this irregular rhythm can strain the heart and lead to failure.</p>
<p>Neck circumference is also tied to coronary heart disease, where narrowed arteries reduce the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart.</p>
<p>The risks don&#x27;t stop at cardiovascular problems. Larger neck size is associated with a greater likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, both of which can lead to long-term complications such as nerve damage, vision loss, and limb amputation.</p>
<p>Sleep disorders are another major concern. A thicker neck is a known risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. This not only leads to severe daytime fatigue but also places additional stress on the heart and blood vessels. People with sleep apnea are also more prone to accidents caused by exhaustion.</p>
<p>When Neck Size Becomes a Warning</p>
<p>So, how big is too big? Research suggests that men with a neck circumference of 17 inches (43 cm) or more, and women with 14 inches (35.5 cm) or more, face elevated health risks.</p>
<p>Perhaps most surprising, these dangers are not limited to people who are overweight. Even individuals with a normal BMI may be at risk if their neck measurements exceed these thresholds. For every additional centimeter beyond that range, the likelihood of hospitalization and early death increases.</p>
<p>If your neck measurement falls above these levels, there&#x27;s no reason for alarm, but it&#x27;s worth noting. Neck size represents only one piece of your overall health profile, yet it can reveal important information that other metrics might overlook.</p>

<h2>Feeling stressed? Science finds a simple way to take back control</h2>
<p><em>Source: Science Daily | <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092833.htm">Original</a></em></p>
<div class="content">
<p>A tight work deadline, a clogged toilet, or a disagreement with a loved one can make an ordinary day feel overwhelming. When several of these small frustrations build up, stress can quickly escalate. But according to new research that includes scientists from Penn State, simply feeling more in control might help make those everyday challenges easier to handle.</p>
<p>The study found that on days when people felt they had greater control over their stressors, they were 62% more likely to take action -- such as calling a plumber or addressing a difficult conversation -- to solve the problem. This effect became even stronger with age. The results suggest that a person&#x27;s sense of control can serve as an important psychological resource that can be strengthened over time to help manage stress and improve health outcomes.</p>
<p>The findings were published in the journal Communications Psychology.</p>
<p>&quot;This research shows that even small boosts in how much control people feel they have over everyday hassles make it more likely that those hassles actually get resolved,&quot; said David Almeida, professor of human development and family studies at Penn State and senior author on the paper. &quot;Learning to find and act on these pockets of control in daily life may not only reduce stress but also support long-term health and well-being.&quot;</p>
<p>Previous work led by Almeida has shown that stress responses fluctuate over time and that even minor daily inconveniences can affect health when they accumulate. Actively resolving stressors -- such as clearing up an argument -- is a key part of processing stress and allows emotions to settle more quickly.</p>
<p>Measuring How Control Affects Stress</p>
<p>In this new study, the researchers wanted to know whether a sense of personal control -- how much people feel they can influence their daily challenges -- affects whether a stressor gets resolved. For instance, does believing you can fix a billing mistake make you more likely to call the company? The team also examined what influences that sense of control, including the type of stress, how often stressors occur, and socioeconomic conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;If perceived stressor control promotes stress resolution, can we leverage that as a modifiable resource to influence stressor resolution and therefore our emotional health and well-being?&quot; asked lead author Dakota Witzel, who was a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for Healthy Aging at Penn State during the time of the research and is now an assistant professor at South Dakota State University.</p>
<p>Tracking Daily Stress Over a Decade</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed data from more than 1,700 adults who took part in the National Study of Daily Experiences, part of the long-running Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS), a national study on health and well-being. For eight consecutive days, participants reported any daily stressors they experienced within the previous 24 hours and whether each stressor was resolved by the end of the day. Common sources of stress included interpersonal tensions (arguments or avoided arguments), home or work overload, and &quot;network stress&quot; -- problems affecting friends or family that still caused distress for the participant.</p>
<p>Participants also rated how much control they felt over each stressor on a four-point scale (none, a little, some, or a lot of control). The same survey was repeated with these participants 10 years later to see whether the connection between perceived control and stress resolution changed with time.</p>
<p>Control Levels Fluctuate From Day to Day</p>
<p>Results showed that people&#x27;s sense of control can shift greatly from one day to the next. In other words, feeling in control is not a fixed personal trait -- it&#x27;s a daily perception that varies depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>Across all ages, on days when people felt more in control than usual -- for instance, feeling &quot;some&quot; control instead of &quot;a little&quot; -- they were significantly more likely to resolve the stressor. This pattern held true regardless of the stressor&#x27;s type or intensity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the connection grew stronger with age. Early in the study, participants who felt a higher-than-usual level of control were 61% more likely to resolve their stressors that day. A decade later, the same boost in perceived control raised that likelihood to 65%.</p>

<h2>Scientists detect hidden brain damage years before MS symptoms</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>By the time most people begin seeking help for multiple sclerosis (MS), the disease has already been quietly injuring the brain for years. Until recently, scientists were uncertain which cells were affected first or when the damage actually started.</p>
<p>Tracking the Disease&#x27;s Earliest Attacks</p>
<p>Researchers at UC San Francisco have now provided the most detailed timeline yet by analyzing thousands of proteins circulating in the blood. Their findings show that the immune system begins attacking the brain&#x27;s protective myelin sheath -- the fatty covering that insulates nerve fibers -- much earlier than scientists once believed.</p>
<p>The team measured fragments of myelin and other molecules left behind by immune attacks, along with the chemical signals that drive the immune system&#x27;s response. This work allowed them to outline, for the first time, the chain of biological events that ultimately leads to the onset of MS.</p>
<p>The discovery opens the door to earlier diagnosis and, in the future, may make prevention possible.</p>
<p>The Body&#x27;s Early Warning Signs</p>
<p>The research showed that MS first targets the myelin sheath. About a year later, evidence of damage to the underlying nerve fibers themselves begins to appear.</p>
<p>Among the immune-related proteins that rose during this initial stage, one stood out: IL-3. This molecule plays a central role in the early disease phase, when the central nervous system is already taking significant damage even though patients do not yet experience symptoms. IL-3 helps recruit immune cells into the brain and spinal cord, where they begin attacking nerve tissue.</p>
<p>&quot;We think our work opens numerous opportunities for diagnosing, monitoring, and possibility treating MS,&quot; said Ahmed Abdelhak, MD, assistant professor of Neurology at UCSF, and the first and co-lead author of the paper, which was published in Nature Medicine on Oct. 20. &quot;It could be a gamechanger for how we understand and manage this disease.&quot;</p>
<p>Following Blood Clues Years Before Diagnosis</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed more than 5,000 different proteins in blood samples from 134 individuals who eventually developed MS. These samples came from the U.S. Department of Defense Serum Repository, which stores blood from military applicants. Because the repository holds samples for decades, scientists were able to examine blood drawn years before these individuals were diagnosed.</p>
<p>Seven years prior to diagnosis, the researchers detected a spike in a protein known as MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein), which signals damage to the myelin insulation around nerve fibers. Roughly a year later, they observed a rise in neurofilament light chain, a marker of injury to the nerve fibers themselves.</p>
<p>During this same window, IL-3 and several related immune proteins appeared in the bloodstream, indicating that an immune assault was already underway.</p>
<p>Building the Foundation for a Predictive Blood Test</p>
<p>In total, the team identified about 50 proteins that could serve as early indicators of MS. They have since filed a patent application for a diagnostic blood test based on the 21 most reliable markers.</p>

<h2>Scientists just found hidden life thriving beneath the Arctic ice</h2>

<p>The rapid loss of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is often seen as an environmental catastrophe. Yet researchers have found that the same melting process could help sustain life in unexpected ways. As the ice retreats, it creates conditions that encourage the growth of algae, the foundation of the Arctic&#x27;s marine food web.</p>
<p>Algae form the base of most ocean ecosystems, but they depend on nitrogen to grow -- and nitrogen is scarce in Arctic waters. Now, an international team led by the University of Copenhagen has discovered that more nitrogen may become available than scientists once believed. This shift could reshape the future of marine life in the region and influence how much carbon the ocean can absorb.</p>
<p>A Hidden Source of Nitrogen Beneath the Ice</p>
<p>The study is the first to confirm that nitrogen fixation -- a process in which certain bacteria transform nitrogen gas (N2) dissolved in seawater into ammonium -- occurs beneath Arctic sea ice, even in its most remote and central areas. Ammonium not only helps these bacteria thrive but also nourishes algae and, by extension, the creatures that depend on them.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now, it was believed that nitrogen fixation could not take place under the sea ice because it was assumed that the living conditions for the organisms that perform nitrogen fixation were too poor. We were wrong,&quot; says Lisa W. von Friesen, lead author of the study and former PhD student at the Department of Biology.</p>
<p>Unlike most other oceans where cyanobacteria dominate nitrogen fixation, the Arctic Ocean relies on an entirely different group of bacteria known as non-cyanobacteria. The researchers found the highest nitrogen fixation rates along the ice edge -- where melting is most intense. While these bacteria can operate beneath the ice, they flourish along the melting boundary. As climate change accelerates ice retreat, this expanding melt zone could allow more nitrogen to enter the ecosystem.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, the amount of available nitrogen in the Arctic Ocean has likely been underestimated, both today and for future projections. This could mean that the potential for algae production has also been underestimated as climate change continues to reduce the sea ice cover,&quot; says von Friesen.</p>
<p>&quot;Because algae are the primary food source for small animals such as planktonic crustaceans, which in turn are eaten by small fish, more algae can end up affecting the entire food chain,&quot; she adds.</p>
<p>Could This Help the Planet Absorb More CO2?</p>
<p>This new nitrogen source could also influence how much carbon dioxide the Arctic Ocean takes in. More algae mean more photosynthesis, which enables the ocean to capture greater amounts of CO2.</p>
<p>&quot;For the climate and the environment, this is likely good news. If algae production increases, the Arctic Ocean will absorb more CO2 because more CO2 will be bound in algae biomass. But biological systems are very complex, so it is hard to make firm predictions, because other mechanisms may pull in the opposite direction,&quot; explains Lasse Riemann, professor at the Department of Biology and senior author of the study.</p>
<p>The researchers emphasize that nitrogen fixation should now be considered in models predicting the Arctic&#x27;s future. &quot;We do not yet know whether the net effect will be beneficial for the climate. But it is clear that we should include an important process such as nitrogen fixation in the equation when we try to predict what will happen to the Arctic Ocean in the coming decades as sea ice declines,&quot; adds Riemann.</p>
<p>In the Arctic, non-cyanobacteria perform nitrogen fixation. These microorganisms consume dissolved organic matter -- often released by algae -- and in turn, produce fixed nitrogen that promotes further algal growth. This exchange creates a small but vital nutrient loop beneath the ice.</p>
<p>Algae play a double role in the ecosystem: they are both the starting point of the marine food chain and natural absorbers of CO2. As they grow, they pull carbon dioxide from the air, which can later sink to the ocean floor as part of their biomass.</p>
<p>The study, published in Communications Earth &amp; Environment, involved scientists from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark), Linnaeus University (Sweden), Alfred Wegener Institute (Germany), Aix Marseille University (France), National Oceanography Centre (United Kingdom), Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (Germany), Stockholm University (Sweden), and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (Sweden).</p>

<h2>Scientists find immune drug that could halt skin cancer’s deadly spread</h2>
<p><em>Source: Science Daily | <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092821.htm">Original</a></em></p>
<div class="content">
<p>A major clinical study by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) has found that an immune-based cancer drug may help reduce the spread of Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare but aggressive type of skin cancer, when used soon after surgery. The phase 3 STAMP trial (EA6174) tested pembrolizumab, a therapy that activates the body&#x27;s immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. While the treatment did not significantly lower the overall risk of recurrence, it did appear to reduce the likelihood of cancer spreading to distant organs -- a key secondary goal of the research.</p>
<p>Pembrolizumab Trial Results Show Reduced Risk of Cancer Spread</p>
<p>The randomized phase 3 STAMP trial is the largest study so far to evaluate pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy for Merkel cell carcinoma after tumor removal. After two years, 73% of patients who received pembrolizumab remained free of cancer, compared with 66% in the group that did not receive the drug. Although this difference was not statistically significant, those treated with pembrolizumab had a 42% lower chance of developing distant metastases, meaning cancer that spread to areas such as the liver, lungs, or bones.</p>
<p>Expert View: &quot;Much-Needed Good News&quot; for Patients</p>
<p>&quot;The STAMP trial provides the first evidence that immunotherapy with pembrolizumab after surgery may help people with Merkel cell carcinoma by preventing their cancer from returning in organs considered distant from the site of the original disease,&quot; said lead investigator Janice M. Mehnert, MD, co-chair of the ECOG-ACRIN Melanoma Committee and director of Melanoma and Cutaneous Medical Oncology at NYU Langone Health&#x27;s Perlmutter Cancer Center. &quot;This is much-needed good news for people who are living with the highly aggressive cancer that is Merkel cell carcinoma,&quot; Dr. Mehnert added.</p>
<p>Understanding Merkel Cell Carcinoma</p>
<p>Merkel cell carcinoma is a fast-developing cancer that starts in the skin&#x27;s touch-sensing cells and often appears as a firm, painless lump on areas frequently exposed to sunlight. Although skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States, Merkel cell carcinoma -- also known as neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin -- is extremely rare, affecting no more than three in one million people each year. It is highly aggressive, with fewer than half of patients surviving five years after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Collaboration Enables Rare Cancer Study</p>
<p>The STAMP trial (NCT03712605) enrolled 293 patients between 2018 and 2023, all of whom had undergone surgery to remove their tumors. Of these, 147 patients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab infusions following surgery, while 146 were monitored without additional drug treatment. Some participants also received radiation therapy as recommended by their doctors.</p>
<p>Because Merkel cell carcinoma is so uncommon, Dr. Mehnert noted that national collaboration was crucial to make the study possible. With support from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), ECOG-ACRIN conducted the trial through the NCI&#x27;s National Clinical Trials Network, involving more than 500 hospitals and cancer centers across the country.</p>
<p>Pembrolizumab belongs to a class of immunotherapies known as PD-1 inhibitors. It works by blocking the PD-1 receptor, a protein cancer cells use to hide from immune system attack. By interrupting this process, pembrolizumab helps immune cells recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already approved pembrolizumab (brand name KEYTRUDA) to treat recurrent locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>Overall survival, the other co-primary endpoint of the trial, continues to be followed and will be reported at a later date.</p>
<p>Dr. Mehnert will present the trial at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2025 Congress on Monday, October 20 in Berlin, Germany.</p>

<h2>Microsoft rushes out emergency fix for Windows 11 bug that stops PCs recovering from boot failures</h2>
<p><em>Source: TechRadar | <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/windows/microsoft-rushes-out-emergency-fix-for-windows-11-bug-that-stops-pcs-recovering-from-boot-failures">Original</a></em></p>
<div class="content">
<p>Recovery Environment is now fixed in Windows 11 25H2</p>
<p>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here&#x27;s how it works.</p>
<p>Microsoft has quickly deployed an emergency patch for Windows 11 outside of its usual schedule of updates to fix a major problem with the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).</p>
<p>XDA Developers spotted the &#x27;out-of-band&#x27; update that has just been released by Microsoft, known as patch KB5070773 for Windows 11 25H2. It was the latest cumulative update (for October) and included the bug for version 25H2, which stopped USB keyboards and mice from working in WinRE.</p>
<p>WinRE is the feature that kicks in if your PC fails to boot, so it&#x27;s vital when disaster strikes your Windows 11 system and you need to recover. Being unable to use the mouse or keyboard renders the environment effectively useless.</p>
<p>In other words, those on Windows 11 25H2 who grabbed the October update, and then subsequently ran into a showstopping issue with their PC, were completely out of luck when it came to resolving that problem using the traditional recovery methods.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, you really don&#x27;t want to be stuck up a boot failure creek without a recovery paddle. So, if you&#x27;re running Windows 11 25H2 with the most recent October update applied, I&#x27;d strongly advise you to download this emergency patch today - now, in fact.</p>
<p>The patch will be installed by Windows Update, so what you need to do is head to that panel in the Settings app (simply type &#x27;Windows Update&#x27; in the search box in the taskbar). Then click on &#x27;Check for updates&#x27; to do just that, and you should see patch KB5070773. At this point, I&#x27;d imagine Microsoft has this available for all Windows 11 25H2 PCs (considering it was first deployed late yesterday, and given how important it is).</p>
<p>Should you not see the update, it&#x27;s possible that your system has already installed it, though you would have seen some indication of that. It&#x27;s possible to miss these things, mind you, and you can always double-check your update history (in the Windows Update panel) to see if KB5070773 is listed.</p>

<p>If you aren&#x27;t being offered this patch, and definitely don&#x27;t already have it, you could manually install the update, providing you&#x27;re confident enough about your Windows 11 PC to do so. In that case, as XDA points out, you can find the patch available for download here in Microsoft&#x27;s Update Catalog.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, in August 2025, Microsoft broke the ability to reset a Windows 11 PC, which again required an emergency fix - so the software giant is on something of a roll when it comes to throwing spanners in the recovery works.</p>

<h2>HBO Max just got more expensive (again) – here’s how to avoid paying more for your subscription</h2>
<p><em>Source: TechRadar | <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/hbo-max-is-getting-more-expensive-again-heres-how-to-avoid-paying-more-for-your-subscription">Original</a></em></p>

<p>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here&#x27;s how it works.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery is making good on its promise to charge more for a HBO Max subscription, announcing a sudden price hike that&#x27;s effective immediately for new subscribers.</p>
<p>According to Variety, the HBO Max price will rise by as much as $2 a month and $20 a year from today (October 21). Every plan has seen a jump in costs, including both the monthly and annual options, making the service one of the most expensive ad-free streaming plans compared to rivals - only Hulu is pricier at $18.99 per month.</p>
<p>$9.99 per month / $99.99 annually</p>
<p>$10.99 per month / $109.99 annually</p>
<p>$16.99 per month / $169.99 annually</p>
<p>$18.49 per month / $184.99 annually</p>
<p>$20.99 per month / $209.99 annually</p>
<p>$22.99 per month / $229.99 annually</p>
<p>HBO Max users are understandably frustrated by the news, with many raising their annoyances on social media platforms. One Reddit thread already has over 500 comments filled with users threatening to cancel their accounts to boycott the rise.</p>
<p>These types of responses have become increasingly familiar, especially in 2025, as HBO Max isn&#x27;t the only platform to have raised prices. Many of the best streaming services have announced similar increases this year, which is a worrying trend for consumers who already have subscription fatigue.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re an existing HBO Max user, then you won&#x27;t see an increase in price until your next billing date, depending on whether that&#x27;s on or after November 20. Meanwhile, anyone signed up to a yearly plan won&#x27;t have to pay the higher prices until their next renewal.</p>
<p>That means that there is still some time to find a way to avoid paying more to watch your favorite movies and shows from the network, as existing subscribers should be notified of any account changes 30 days before the increase kicks in.</p>
<p>My advice? Take a look at the best streaming deals, as there are some offers worth taking advantage of if you still want to keep accessing the service. Unfortunately, given that the increase applies to both monthly and annual plans, the annual plan savings don&#x27;t offer as much value as they once did.</p>

<p>Online sales and logistics outage stops Muji in its tracks</p>
<p>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here&#x27;s how it works.</p>
<p>Muji has been forced to halt much of its operations after its delivery partner, Askul, was targeted in a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>The Japanese clothing and homeware retailer confirmed that the incident has impacted browsing, online purchases, order histories through the Munji app, and the display of web content.</p>
<p>If customer data has been compromised, especially personally identifiable information like names, addresses, email addresses, or even financial data - this could leave customers at risk of identity theft, as criminals could use their information to take out credit cards or loans.</p>
<p>&#x27;The ASKUL website is currently experiencing a system outage due to a ransomware infection, halting order acceptance and shipping operations,&#x27; Askul&#x27;s statement confirmed (translated through Google Translate).</p>
<p>&#x27;We are currently investigating the extent of the impact, including the leak of personal information and customer data, and will notify you as soon as it is clear,&#x27; Askul added.</p>
<p>Askul only provides ecommerce logistics to the Japanese branch of Muji, so stores in other parts of the world seem to remain unaffected.</p>
<p>The series of retailer attacks bring forward the vulnerabilities from third-party suppliers.</p>
<p>Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!</p>
<p>The incident is the latest in a seemingly never-ending string of ransomware attacks hitting high-street stores and retailers.</p>
<p>Most recently, Japanese beer giant Asahi, and carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, had to halt production lines following serious cyberattacks.</p>
<p>These third party breaches should serve as a wake-up call for modern cybersecurity teams, and underscore the need for vigilance, accountability, and transparency.</p>
<p>The increased reliance on outside vendors drastically increases the attack surface that malicious actors can target. Large retailers may have the budget and manpower to bolster their cyber defenses - but smaller software, logistics, or manufacturing companies may not have the same resources or protections.</p>

<h2>Microsoft is attempting to distance itself from the ROG Xbox Ally pricing fiasco – and supply leaks highlight that</h2>
<p><em>Source: TechRadar | <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-attempting-to-distance-itself-from-the-rog-xbox-ally-pricing-fiasco-and-supply-leaks-highlight-that">Original</a></em></p>
<div class="content">
<p>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here&#x27;s how it works.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not been long since the launch of the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, and it appears as though the controversial pricing of the higher-end ROG Xbox Ally X may have had more to do with its manufacturer than Microsoft and Xbox, amid some supply concerns.</p>
<p>As reported by Notebookcheck, Xbox President Sarah Bond revealed that Microsoft relied on Asus to &#x27;determine the ultimate prices of the devices&#x27;. This comes at the same time as supply leaks from Moore&#x27;s Law Is Dead (MLID), which suggests that ROG Xbox Ally X stock is scarce and may not have steady resupplies.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X, the more powerful variant using AMD&#x27;s Ryzen Z2 Extreme, starts at $999 / £799 / AU$1,599, which has been the point of contention for many consumers (including me), especially when considering the lack of a performance leap it makes from the Asus ROG Ally or Asus ROG Ally X using the Ryzen Z1 Extreme.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that MLID&#x27;s source, which is a major unnamed US retailer, hinted at more stock available for the ROG Xbox Ally using the weaker Ryzen Z2 A processor, but consumers aren&#x27;t opting for this model, likely due to its $599 / £499 / AU$999 price. The supply situation with the ROG Xbox Ally X is also compared to that of Nvidia&#x27;s RTX 5080 launch, which was hardly available at launch.</p>
<p>These supply leaks may go a long way to indicate a few things, but a notable one could be that Microsoft and Xbox may not have been completely confident in the launch of its ROG Xbox Ally devices in terms of sales, specifically the ROG Xbox Ally X due to its high $999 price, potentially made evident by a supposed lack of supply at launch and rumors pointing towards little to no urgency for resupply.</p>
<p>While the Xbox Ally X may be sold out, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily indicate huge success in terms of sales, specifically if these limited supply leaks are legitimate.</p>
<p>Sarah Bond&#x27;s comments on pricing almost sound like &#x27;it&#x27;s something Asus saw fit&#x27; to shift the heat of the controversy away from Microsoft, but the Xbox President also didn&#x27;t shy away from backing up Asus&#x27; price tags, stating &#x27;the reaction was overwhelming demand for the device&#x27; and &#x27;feeling really good about the value for gamers for the price&#x27;, and frankly, that may not resonate with consumers.</p>
<p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p>
<p>You could say it&#x27;s a bit of stretch, but it sounds like the paper launch for the ROG Xbox Ally X handheld has been perfect for Microsoft to strategically claim the device was a major success sales-wise, but in fact, it seems to be mostly sold out due to a lack of supply.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be a surprise either, considering what the device has to offer; the MSI Claw 8 AI+ is within the same price region as the ROG Xbox Ally X, and delivers better performance thanks to its Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor, all on a larger 8-inch display. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 (although ridiculously overpriced) has an OLED screen starting around the same price as the ROG Xbox Ally X, providing better value as well.</p>
<p>These factors make a potential move to the Xbox handheld less appealing to consumers, and I&#x27;m willing to bet that if supply were at least slightly more plentiful, then it wouldn&#x27;t be the same story.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also still early days, so it will be hard to grasp just how well the handheld has done right now - but I won&#x27;t be surprised if significant price drops come into place later down the line due to a lack of purchases, including the ROG Xbox Ally, which is seemingly already sitting idly on shelves.</p>

<p>NPR&#x27;s Tamara Keith and Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter join Geoff Bennett to discuss the latest political news, including the millions taking to the streets to protest President Trump&#x27;s agenda, the government shutdown entering its third full week with no resolution, whether GOP redistricting efforts could help them win and the start of work on Trump&#x27;s White House ballroom.</p>
<p>Millions of people took to the streets throughout the country this weekend to protest President Donald Trump&#x27;s agenda as the government shutdown enters its third full week with no clear resolution.</p>
<p>For more, we&#x27;re joined by our Politics Monday duo. That&#x27;s Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter and Tamara Keith of NPR.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s always great to see you both.</p>
<p>Tamara Keith, National Public Radio:</p>
<p>Amy Walter, The Cook Political Report:</p>
<p>So, some seven million people, according to the organizers, they protested, demonstrated across some 2,500 cities. The president dismissed this weekend&#x27;s massive protests. You see the images there from this past weekend. He dismissed them as a joke, saying that the people involved were not representative of the country.</p>
<p>Take a listen to what he had to say.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, President of the United States: I think it&#x27;s a joke. I looked at the people. They&#x27;re not representative of this country. And, by the way, I&#x27;m not a king. I&#x27;m not a king. I have worked my ass off to make our country great. That&#x27;s all it is. I&#x27;m not a king at all.</p>
<p>Congratulations. They didn&#x27;t burn any buildings down. That&#x27;s a big achievement for the left to have some kind of gathering where they don&#x27;t have looting and riots and burn a building down.</p>
<p>Again, some seven million people, 2,500 cities. This clearly aggravated him a little bit.</p>
<p>Yes. And part of President Trump&#x27;s power in this second term has come from an air of invincibility, of inevitability, of having power and being able to use it.</p>
<p>And what these demonstrators showed, mostly what they showed each other, is that they aren&#x27;t alone and that there are people who actually do oppose the president. He has - by sort of saying, ah, this isn&#x27;t a big deal and all of that, he is - and also putting out a video, an A.I.-altered - or not altered, an A.I.-created video of himself flying a fighter jet with a crown on his head, much like a king, dropping what looks like excrement on protesters, he&#x27;s trying to downplay something that is real and is a part of America.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&#x27;s not all of America. It&#x27;s not his part of America. He has repeatedly, by - during the government shutdown, for instance, saying, I&#x27;m going to defund Democrat things and Democrat states, to use the phrasing that he has used, he is essentially saying he&#x27;s president for a different America.</p>
<p>And, Amy, it&#x27;s not at all surprising that the president would dismiss these protests.</p>

<h2>Comey’s lawyers say case against him is driven by Trump’s ‘personal animus’ and must be thrown out</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey urged a judge Monday to dismiss the case against him, calling it a vindictive prosecution motivated by &quot;personal animus&quot; and orchestrated by a White House determined to seek retribution against a perceived foe of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The lawyers separately called for the indictment&#x27;s dismissal because of what they said was the illegitimate appointment of the U.S. attorney who filed the case days after being hastily named to the job by Trump.</p>
<p>Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.</p>
<p>The two-prong attack on the indictment, which accuses Comey of lying to Congress five years ago, represents the opening salvo in what is expected to be a protracted court fight ahead of a trial currently set for Jan. 5. The motions take aim not at the substance of the allegations but rather on the unusual circumstances of the prosecution, which included Trump exhorting his attorney general to bring charges against Comey as well as his administration&#x27;s abrupt installation of a White House aide to serve as top prosecutor of the elite office overseeing the case.</p>
<p>&quot;Bedrock principles of due process and equal protection have long ensured that government officials may not use courts to punish and imprison their perceived personal and political enemies,&quot; wrote Comey&#x27;s defense team, which includes Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. Attorney in Chicago and a longtime Comey friend. &quot;But that is exactly what happened here.&quot;</p>
<p>MORE: Read the Trump administration&#x27;s full indictment of former FBI Director Comey</p>
<p>They said the Justice Department had brought the case because of Trump&#x27;s hatred of Comey, who as FBI director in the first months of Trump&#x27;s first term infuriated the president through his oversight of an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign. Trump fired Comey in May 2017. The two have been open adversaries in the years since, with Comey labeling Trump &quot;unethical&quot; and comparing him to a mafia boss and Trump branding Comey an &quot;untruthful slimeball&quot; and calling for him to be punished because of the Russia investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has singled out Mr. Comey for prosecution because of his protected speech and because of President Trump&#x27;s personal animus toward Mr. Comey,&quot; defense lawyers wrote, adding that such a &quot;vindictive and selection prosecution&quot; violates multiple provisions of the Constitution and must be dismissed.</p>
<p>Comey&#x27;s defense team had foreshadowed the arguments during his first and only court appearance in the case, where he pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Though motions alleging vindictive prosecutions do not often succeed, this one lays out a timeline of events intended to link Trump&#x27;s demands for a prosecution with the Justice Department&#x27;s scramble to secure an indictment last month just before the statute of limitations was set to lapse.</p>
<p>Last month, for instance, he complained in a Truth Social post directed to Attorney General Pam Bondi that &quot;nothing is being done&quot; on investigations into some of his foes and called for action, specifically referencing inquiries into Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.</p>
<p>&quot;JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!&quot; part of the message said.</p>
<p>He installed Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who had been one of Trump&#x27;s personal lawyers but had no experience as a federal prosecutor, to run the Eastern District of Virginia and replace Erik Siebert, who had resigned as U.S. attorney one day earlier amid administration pressure to charge Comey and James. Comey was indicted days later.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent&#x27;s rich rare-earth resources when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.</p>
<p>The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.</p>
<p>&quot;In about a year from now we&#x27;ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won&#x27;t know what to do with them,&quot; said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. &quot;They&#x27;ll be worth $2.&quot;</p>
<p>Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.</p>
<p>Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship &quot;to the next level.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.</p>
<p>&quot;Australia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we&#x27;re seeing from the Chinese,&quot; Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House&#x27;s National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump&#x27;s meeting with Albanese.</p>
<p>Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.</p>
<p>The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years - if not decades - to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce their dominance.</p>
<p>Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.</p>
<p>For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.</p>
<p>&quot;Taking away that arrow of China&#x27;s to be able to manipulate pricing is a crucial first step for Australia and the West to be able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our demands,&quot; said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.</p>
<p>The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China&#x27;s influence.</p>

<p>PETERSBURG, Va. (AP) - Rae Pickett stepped onto Richell Hines&#x27; front stoop wearing a pink T-shirt that foretold the case she hoped to make to Virginia voters as she knocked on doors on a sunny Saturday in early October.</p>
<p>&quot;Abortion is on the ballot,&quot; it read.</p>
<p>Hines answered Pickett&#x27;s knock on her Petersburg, Virginia, door with a disarming smile and a T-shirt of her own: &quot;She who kneels before God can stand before anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>The polite exchange that followed between Pickett and Hines revealed the complexity of one of the most vivid policy differences between the two women vying to be the first female governor of Virginia - Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. The winner will likely influence abortion law in the only Southern state that&#x27;s maintained broad access to abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 eliminated a national right to the procedure.</p>
<p>Spanberger, a former congresswoman, supports a proposed state constitutional amendment that&#x27;ll reach voters only if Democrats maintain their House of Delegates majority. Earle-Sears, Virginia&#x27;s lieutenant governor, has been an outspoken abortion rights opponent throughout her political career.</p>
<p>Both candidates have cast the other as an outlier on abortion. But they&#x27;re also focusing on other matters, like Spanberger&#x27;s emphasis on the economy and Earle-Sears&#x27; opposition to transgender people&#x27;s rights.</p>
<p>Pickett, who works for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, specifically went to the homes of voters who hadn&#x27;t yet cast ballots in a Democratic-leaning neighborhood. She quickly encouraged those who answered to vote. If those folks backed Democrats in the competitive House of Delegates district - regardless of their reasoning - she knew they were effectively voting for abortion rights, too.</p>
<p>&quot;I do understand in some circumstances it&#x27;s needed and others it&#x27;s preventable,&quot; Hines said when asked her views on abortion.</p>
<p>She added, sighing: &quot;That&#x27;s a hard one.&quot;</p>
<p>Nationally, advocates across the abortion rights spectrum are watching Virginia for clues about how the issue might resonate in 2026 midterm campaigns, with control of Congress and dozens of statehouses at stake.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that the elections here signal what the tone and temperature could be in other elections going forward,&quot; said Olivia Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, which opposes abortion rights.</p>
<p>About 6 in 10 Virginia voters in the 2024 presidential election said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters. More than half of Virginia voters said they&#x27;d oppose banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy nationwide. Slightly fewer than half said they&#x27;d favor such a restriction.</p>
<p>Polling also indicates most people believe abortion should be allowed in some circumstances but not others, roughly in line with national numbers: 62% of U.S. voters last November said abortion should be legal in at least &quot;most&quot; cases.</p>

<h2>Supreme Court will consider whether people who regularly smoke pot can legally own guns</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court said on Monday that it will consider whether people who regularly smoke marijuana can legally own guns, the latest firearm case to come before the court since its 2022 decision expanding gun rights.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump&#x27;s administration asked the justices to revive a case against a Texas man charged with a felony because he allegedly had a gun in his home and acknowledged being a regular pot user. The Justice Department appealed after a lower court largely struck down a law that bars people who use any illegal drugs from having guns.</p>
<p>Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.</p>
<p>Last year, a jury convicted Hunter Biden of violating the law, among other charges. His father, then-President Joe Biden, later pardoned him.</p>
<p>Arguments probably will take place early in 2026, with a decision likely by early summer.</p>
<p>The Republican administration favors Second Amendment rights, but government attorneys argued that this ban is a justifiable restriction.</p>
<p>They asked the court to reinstate a case against Ali Danial Hemani. His lawyers got the felony charge tossed out after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the blanket ban is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court&#x27;s expanded view of gun rights. The appellate judges found it could still be used against people accused of being high and armed at the same time, though.</p>
<p>Hemani&#x27;s attorneys argue the broadly written law puts millions of people at risk of technical violations since at least 20% of Americans have tried pot, according to government health data. About half of states legalized recreational marijuana, but it&#x27;s still illegal under federal law.</p>
<p>The Justice Department argues the law is valid when used against regular drug users because they pose a serious public safety risk. The government said the FBI found Hemani&#x27;s gun and cocaine in a search of his home as they probed travel and communications allegedly linked to Iran. The gun charge was the only one filed, however, and his lawyers said the other allegations were irrelevant and were mentioned only to make him seem more dangerous.</p>
<p>The case marks another flashpoint in the application of the Supreme Court&#x27;s new test for firearm restrictions. The conservative majority found in 2022 that the Second Amendment generally gives people the right to carry guns in public for self-defense and any firearm restrictions must have a strong grounding in the nation&#x27;s history.</p>
<p>The landmark 2022 ruling led to a cascade of challenges to firearm laws around the country, though the justices have since upheld a different federal law intended to protect victims of domestic violence by barring guns from people under restraining orders.</p>

<h2>Tiny AI-powered eye implant helps the blind see again</h2>

<p>People who had lost their sight have regained the ability to read after receiving an innovative electronic eye implant paired with augmented-reality glasses, according to a clinical trial involving researchers from UCL (University College London) and Moorfields Eye Hospital.</p>
<p>Published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the European trial reported that 84% of participants could once again recognize letters, numbers, and words using prosthetic vision in an eye that had previously gone blind due to geographic atrophy caused by dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a currently untreatable condition.</p>
<p>Participants treated with the device were able to read an average of five lines on a standard vision chart. Before surgery, several could not even distinguish the chart at all.</p>
<p>Breakthrough Study and Participants</p>
<p>The study enrolled 38 patients across 17 hospitals in five countries, testing a pioneering implant known as PRIMA. Moorfields Eye Hospital served as the only UK site. All participants had completely lost central vision in the treated eye before receiving the implant.</p>
<p>Dry AMD gradually destroys the light-sensitive cells of the macula, eroding central vision over time. In its advanced stage, called geographic atrophy (GA), the degeneration can lead to total blindness in the affected eye as the central macula deteriorates. Around 5 million people worldwide live with GA, for which no treatment currently exists. Those enrolled in the study retained only peripheral vision.</p>
<p>This implant is the first of its kind capable of restoring the ability to read letters, numbers, and words through an eye that had lost its sight.</p>
<p>A New Era of Artificial Vision</p>
<p>Mr. Mahi Muqit, associate professor at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and senior vitreoretinal consultant at Moorfields Eye Hospital, led the UK arm of the trial. He said: &quot;In the history of artificial vision, this represents a new era. Blind patients are actually able to have meaningful central vision restoration, which has never been done before.</p>
<p>&quot;Getting back the ability to read is a major improvement in their quality of life, lifts their mood and helps to restore their confidence and independence. The PRIMA chip operation can safely be performed by any trained vitreoretinal surgeon in under two hours -- that is key for allowing all blind patients to have access to this new medical therapy for GA in dry AMD.&quot;</p>
<p>The procedure begins with a vitrectomy, where the eye&#x27;s vitreous gel is removed from between the lens and the retina. The surgeon then inserts a microchip shaped like a SIM card, only 2mm by 2mm, beneath the central retina through a small opening.</p>
<p>After surgery, patients use augmented-reality glasses equipped with a video camera linked to a pocket-sized computer with a zoom feature worn at the waist.</p>
<p>About a month after surgery, once the eye has healed, the implant is activated. The glasses&#x27; camera captures visual scenes and projects them as an infra-red beam across the chip. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the computer process this data and convert it into electrical signals, which travel through retinal and optic nerve cells to the brain. The brain interprets these signals as images, allowing patients to perceive vision.</p>
<p>With training, patients learn to scan text using the glasses and adjust the zoom to read. Each participant underwent several months of rehabilitation to interpret these new signals and regain reading skills.</p>
<p>No participant experienced a decline in their remaining peripheral vision. The results pave the way for regulatory approval of the device and broader clinical use.</p>

<h2>Are cancer surgeries removing the body’s secret weapon against cancer?</h2>

<p>A research group led by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Doherty Institute) has uncovered new details about how lymph nodes help the body fight persistent infections and cancer by coordinating key immune cell activity.</p>
<p>Published in two Nature Immunology papers, the findings show that lymph nodes create the ideal setting for stem-like T cells -- an essential type of immune cell -- to survive, multiply, and generate the &quot;killer&quot; T cells that target viruses and tumors. In contrast, other immune organs like the spleen do not support these processes as effectively, highlighting the lymph nodes&#x27; importance for strong immune defenses and successful immunotherapy.</p>
<p>According to Professor Axel Kallies, Laboratory Head at the Doherty Institute and senior author of both studies, these discoveries could reshape approaches to cancer treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;Lymph nodes aren&#x27;t just passive waiting rooms for immune cells, they actively train and educate T cells, and send them off to do their job,&quot; said Professor Kallies.</p>
<p>&quot;Our research suggests that removing lymph nodes during cancer surgery, a common practice to prevent tumor spread, may inadvertently reduce the effectiveness of treatments, such as checkpoint blockade and CAR T cell therapies. Preserving lymph nodes could strengthen immune responses and increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy.&quot;</p>
<p>The research also offers insight into why some patients respond better to immunotherapy than others. The condition and function of lymph nodes appear to influence how effectively the immune system produces cancer-fighting T cells, which can directly affect treatment outcomes.</p>
<p>Dr. Carlson Tsui, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Melbourne and first author of one of the papers, said the team&#x27;s work could pave the way for more powerful and precise immune-based treatments.</p>
<p>&quot;Our research identifies molecular signals that are involved in the regulation of stem-like cells and in their capacity to produce effective killer cells. These findings could guide the development and refinement of immune-based treatments for cancer and chronic infection,&quot; said Dr. Tsui.</p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, our research shows that rather than only focusing on the tumor itself, therapies should also be designed to preserve and enhance lymph node function. By targeting these critical immune hubs, we could boost the body&#x27;s natural ability to fight cancer, increase the effectiveness of existing immunotherapies and help more patients respond to treatment.&quot;</p>
<p>Together, the two peer-reviewed papers provide a deeper understanding of how lymph nodes shape immune responses. While they are based on work with animal models, they will guide future treatment strategies for chronic infection and cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Professor Shahneen Sandhu, Research Lead for the Melanoma Medical Oncology Service at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, commented on the clinical implications of this work.</p>
<p>&quot;While this research was done in the laboratory with pre-clinical models, we&#x27;re excited to study these findings in clinical samples from patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors, as part of an ongoing Melanoma Research Victoria collaboration with Professor Kallies,&quot; Professor Sandhu said.</p>
<p>&quot;Combining clinical and preclinical studies will help us translate these discoveries from bench to bedside and back, ultimately improving outcomes for cancer patients.&quot;</p>
<p>Collaboration: This research was led by the Doherty Institute and conducted in collaboration with University Hospital Bonn, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, WEHI, ETH Zürich, IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute and The University of Queensland.</p>

<h2>This common vitamin could cut your skin cancer risk in half</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>Since 2015, dermatologists have advised many patients with a history of skin cancer to consider taking nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3. That recommendation was based on a clinical trial involving 386 participants, which found that those who took nicotinamide developed fewer new cases of skin cancer compared with those who did not.</p>
<p>Expanding the Evidence with a Larger Patient Group</p>
<p>Until now, confirming those earlier findings in a much larger population has been difficult. Because nicotinamide is available over the counter, its use is rarely documented in medical records. To overcome that obstacle, researchers turned to the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse, where nicotinamide is listed on the VA&#x27;s official formulary.</p>
<p>Using these records, the research team reviewed the outcomes of 33,833 veterans who received baseline treatment with 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice daily for more than 30 days. They tracked each patient&#x27;s next diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>Large Study Reveals Significant Risk Reduction</p>
<p>Among those studied, 12,287 patients had taken nicotinamide, while 21,479 had not. The researchers found a 14% overall decrease in skin cancer risk among nicotinamide users. For those who began taking the supplement after experiencing their first skin cancer, the risk reduction jumped to 54%. However, this benefit lessened when treatment began after multiple skin cancers had already developed. The effect was strongest for squamous cell carcinoma, one of the most common nonmelanoma skin cancers.</p>
<p>Early Use Could Shift Prevention Strategies</p>
<p>&quot;There are no guidelines for when to start treatment with nicotinamide for skin cancer prevention in the general population. These results would really shift our practice from starting it once patients have developed numerous skin cancers to starting it earlier. We still need to do a better job of identifying who will actually benefit, as roughly only half of patients will develop multiple skin cancers,&quot;</p>
<p>said the study&#x27;s corresponding author, Lee Wheless, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Dermatology and Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and staff physician at the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System.</p>
<p>Findings in Transplant Patients</p>
<p>The team also evaluated 1,334 patients who were immunocompromised due to solid organ transplants. In this group, overall risk reduction was not statistically significant, although early use of nicotinamide was linked to fewer cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>Research Collaboration and Support</p>
<p>Wheless&#x27;s work was supported by a Department of Veterans Affairs grant (IK2CX002452). Co-authors from Vanderbilt University included Katyln Knox, Rachel Weiss, Siwei Zhang, PhD, Lydia Yao, MS, Yaomin Xu, PhD, and Kyle Maas.</p>

<p>Scientists believe that the remarkable longevity of naked mole-rats may be tied to subtle changes in just four amino acids. A recent study found that small evolutionary mutations in cGAS -- an enzyme in the innate immune system that detects DNA and triggers immune defenses -- could make these animals better at repairing age-related genetic damage. In contrast, the same enzyme in mice and humans can actually hinder DNA repair.</p>
<p>Despite their wrinkled, almost alien appearance, naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are extraordinary among rodents, living up to 40 years, or about ten times longer than most animals their size. Surprisingly, their genetic blueprint is closer to humans than to mice, making them an important species for studying how organisms maintain health over long lifespans. One crucial element of longevity is the ability to preserve genome stability. Yet how naked mole-rats manage to keep their DNA so resilient has remained largely unclear.</p>
<p>How Naked Mole-Rats Protect Their DNA</p>
<p>A key process involved in maintaining DNA integrity is homologous recombination (HR), a pathway that repairs genetic breaks. When this process fails, it can accelerate aging and increase the risk of cancer. In humans and mice, the DNA-sensing enzyme cGAS (cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase) is known to interfere with HR repair, which can lead to genome instability and a shorter lifespan.</p>
<p>To understand whether naked mole-rats have found a way around this limitation, Yu Chen and colleagues examined how their version of cGAS behaves. The researchers discovered that four amino acid substitutions in the naked mole-rat&#x27;s cGAS reduce the protein&#x27;s tagging for degradation, allowing it to remain active longer and accumulate after DNA damage. This stability enables the enzyme to interact more effectively with important DNA repair proteins, including FANCI and RAD50, strengthening the HR repair process.</p>
<p>Evolutionary Mutations That Extend Life</p>
<p>When the scientists removed cGAS from naked mole-rat cells, the amount of DNA damage sharply increased, confirming the enzyme&#x27;s protective role. Even more strikingly, fruit flies genetically engineered to carry the same four naked mole-rat-specific mutations in human cGAS lived longer than flies with the normal version of the enzyme.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that just a few precise molecular tweaks may help explain why naked mole-rats live so long. The mutations appear to turn cGAS from a potential inhibitor into a powerful ally of DNA repair, offering the animals a natural mechanism to combat the effects of aging.</p>
<p>A New Clue in the Search for Longevity</p>
<p>&quot;The findings from Chen et al. describe an unexpected role for naked mole-rat cGAS in the nucleus that influences longevity,&quot; write John Martinez and colleagues in a related Perspective. &quot;Further research will be required to establish the roles that cGAS may play in the nucleus in other organisms, both short- and long-lived, but the answer may be substantially more complex than originally predicted.&quot;</p>

<h2>Scientists reveal the best exercise to ease knee arthritis pain</h2>

<p>People living with knee osteoarthritis may find the greatest relief from aerobic activities such as walking, cycling, or swimming, according to a new study published in The BMJ. Researchers found that these forms of exercise were the most effective for easing pain, improving movement, and enhancing overall quality of life.</p>
<p>Although other exercise types can provide added benefits, the researchers emphasized that aerobic activity should remain the foundation of treatment. Osteoarthritis develops when the cartilage cushioning the ends of bones wears down, leading to swelling, stiffness, and discomfort. It can affect any joint, but the knees are most commonly impacted. About 30% of adults over age 45 show signs of knee osteoarthritis on x-rays, and roughly half of them experience significant pain and mobility problems.</p>
<p>Filling the Evidence Gap in Exercise Guidance</p>
<p>Exercise is a cornerstone of osteoarthritis care, yet many medical guidelines lack clear direction on which kinds are most beneficial for knee osteoarthritis specifically. To clarify this, researchers analyzed the effectiveness and safety of several exercise approaches.</p>
<p>Their comprehensive analysis drew on 217 randomized clinical trials conducted between 1990 and 2024. In total, the research included 15,684 participants and compared multiple exercise categories -- including aerobic, flexibility, strengthening, mind-body, neuromotor, and mixed programs -- against control groups.</p>
<p>Evaluating Pain Relief, Function, and Mobility</p>
<p>The trials varied in quality, but the team assessed the strength of the evidence using the internationally recognized GRADE system. They examined several key outcomes: pain reduction, physical function, gait performance, and quality of life. Each was measured at short term (four weeks), mid-term (12 weeks), and long term (24 weeks) follow-ups.</p>
<p>Across these studies, aerobic exercise consistently ranked highest in improving outcomes among all exercise types tested.</p>
<p>Aerobic Activity Delivers the Broadest Benefits</p>
<p>Moderate-certainty evidence showed that, compared with control groups, aerobic exercise effectively reduced short- and mid-term pain and improved function in both the short and long term. It also enhanced gait performance and quality of life over short and mid-term periods.</p>
<p>Other exercise forms showed value too. Mind-body workouts likely provided a notable improvement in short-term function, neuromotor exercises likely boosted short-term gait performance, and strengthening or mixed routines improved function in the mid-term.</p>
<p>Safe and Effective for Long-Term Use</p>
<p>Importantly, none of the exercise types resulted in more adverse events than the control groups, indicating that these therapies are generally safe.</p>
<p>The authors did acknowledge some study limitations. Many results came from indirect comparisons, certain outcomes lacked long-term data, and smaller studies may have influenced some early findings.</p>
<p>Clear Takeaway for Patients and CliniciansDespite these limitations, the researchers describe their work as one of the most complete and current evaluations of exercise for managing knee osteoarthritis. They believe the findings will help clinicians make more targeted recommendations.</p>

<h2>Microsoft&#x27;s latest prod to use Copilot AI in the Edge browser is subtle, but still annoying - and I&#x27;m getting fed up with this</h2>

<p>Microsoft&#x27;s latest idea to promote its services is an attempt to get people who are using ChatGPT or Perplexity AI to try Copilot instead.</p>
<p>Windows Latest reports that this is happening for those using Microsoft Edge. When you visit either the ChatGPT or Perplexity websites in Microsoft&#x27;s browser, there&#x27;s a button that appears on the far-right of Edge&#x27;s web address bar which urges you to &#x27;Try Copilot&#x27; instead (with a small Copilot icon next to it).</p>
<p>It&#x27;s relatively subtle - by Microsoft&#x27;s standards - but visible enough, and if you click on it, Edge will open Copilot in its sidebar. Obviously, the hope is that you&#x27;ll use Microsoft&#x27;s AI rather than either ChatGPT or Perplexity, and therefore Microsoft is trying to poach traffic here.</p>
<p>I tried opening both these rival AI websites in my Edge browser, and just as Windows Latest promised, this button popped up in the URL bar. Oddly enough, it didn&#x27;t appear the first time I went to the ChatGPT site, but it did appear on the second visit.</p>
<p>This appears to be happening with ChatGPT and Perplexity (plus Deepseek, the Chinese AI), but notably not with Google&#x27;s Gemini AI - which seems odd, as Microsoft has no qualms about trying to warn Edge users off downloading Chrome, as we&#x27;ve seen in the past, and that&#x27;s still true today.</p>
<p>In fact, navigate to the Chrome download site in Edge and you&#x27;ll get a full pop-up, not just a tiny icon, trying to dissuade you from defecting to Google. It explains that Edge uses the same tech as Chrome - namely the Chromium engine - but with the &quot;added trust of Microsoft&quot;, whatever that means.</p>
<p>So, these kinds of nudges are quite commonplace for Microsoft&#x27;s browser, and indeed in the interests of fairness, Google gets up to the same kind of online cajoling in the reverse direction.</p>
<p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p>
<p>At any rate, this promotion of AI isn&#x27;t anything new. We&#x27;ve seen this kind of thing before with Microsoft trying to hijack a Bing search for rival AI services and redirect people to the Copilot AI in Edge, after all. And given Microsoft&#x27;s overall big push with AI - which is now becoming very obvious with all the latest developments in Windows 11 - it&#x27;s really no surprise to see more of this type of activity.</p>
<p>That doesn&#x27;t make it any less disappointing, though, as Microsoft seems to be getting increasingly heavy-handed with all its promotional tricks in Windows and Edge. That suggests the company has evidence that this kind of nudging works, but for me, it&#x27;s just an annoyance, and one that makes me less likely to use any given product. Edge, Copilot, or other Microsoft services should stand on their own merit (and indeed the irony is that Edge very much does, seeing as it&#x27;s our current pick for the best web browser).</p>
<p>Incidentally, I asked ChatGPT whether it was aware of Microsoft Edge&#x27;s behavior while visiting its site, and as you&#x27;d expect, the AI acknowledged reports around this - though it remained implacably neutral in terms of its general tone. Interestingly, ChatGPT did suggest turning off the Copilot button (to the right-hand side of the address bar) to get rid of this particular &#x27;Try Copilot&#x27; nudge, and would you believe that this worked for me. With the main Copilot button disabled, I didn&#x27;t see Microsoft&#x27;s nag in the address bar any longer (at least in my brief testing).</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re wondering how to turn off that Copilot button, in the Edge address bar, type the following to access this part of the browser&#x27;s settings:</p>
<p>At the bottom in the &#x27;App specific settings&#x27; panel, click on &#x27;Copilot&#x27; and where it says &#x27;Show Copilot button on the toolbar&#x27;, turn this off. You&#x27;ll no longer have a Copilot button, and hopefully won&#x27;t see any Copilot-related suggestions in Edge&#x27;s address bar - or at least fewer of them.</p>

<h2>Channel 4 makes history with Britain’s first AI TV presenter and viewers are likening the twist to ‘Black Mirror’</h2>

<p>There&#x27;s no doubt that AI usage is increasing in the entertainment world and the best streaming services, but UK broadcaster Channel 4 has taken that one step further by unveiling Britain&#x27;s first AI TV presenter.</p>
<p>In the new documentary Will AI Take My Job? Dispatches, which first aired on October 20, the presenter was revealed to be AI-generated in its closing moments. As our host tells us, &quot;I&#x27;m not real. In a British TV first, I&#x27;m an AI presenter. Some of you might have guessed: I don&#x27;t exist, I wasn&#x27;t on location reporting this story. My image and voice were generated using AI.&quot;</p>
<p>Head of news and current affairs, specialist factual and sport at Channel 4 Louisa Compton added in a press statement: &quot;The use of an AI presenter is not something we will be making a habit of at Channel 4 - instead our focus in news and current affairs is on premium, fact checked, duly impartial and trusted journalism - something AI is not capable of doing.</p>
<p>&quot;But this stunt does serve as a useful reminder of just how disruptive AI has the potential to be - and how easy it is to hoodwink audiences with content they have no way of verifying.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet it&#x27;s potentially too little, too late for Channel 4 to present such a real danger and immediately recant it. Viewers are already likening the experience to a Black Mirror episode, and I&#x27;m not buying it as a one-off experiment.</p>
<p>As one viewer said on X/Twitter: &quot;A twist! In #Dispatches! It&#x27;s like Black Mirror!&quot; They&#x27;re not wrong. The new documentary is crafted with more shrewd intent and cunning reveals than most TV shows or movies we&#x27;ve consumed in the last few years, and I think we&#x27;ll take the wrong message away from it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s probably fairly clear by now, thanks to *gestures vaguely around*, that us humans don&#x27;t have the best sense of judgement. As I wrote when AI actress Tilly Norwood began to make waves in Hollywood, &quot;I can&#x27;t help thinking of that viral quote from Joanna Maciejewska when it comes to the likes of Tilly Norwood: &#x27;I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p>
<p>Where is Norwood now, other than an old news story we&#x27;ve already forgotten, lost in the never-ending digital cycle of information? My best guess is that we&#x27;ll be outraged by Channel 4&#x27;s stunt for all of 30 collective seconds before we forgivingly move on, forgetting it has ever happened at all.</p>
<p>Frankly, that&#x27;s not good enough. Not only do we need to do more - industry professionals, media outlets, audiences, the lot - to get the best balance of AI in entertainment possible, but this stunt has likely opened the door for more talent to be generated rather than hired. As Norwood and Channel 4 have proved, we&#x27;re at the tip of a dangerous iceberg.</p>
<p>Look through any TechRadar coverage by my brilliant colleagues and you will find many exceptional uses for AI, in and out of creative fields. However, AI is not needed when it comes to talent access or documentary storytelling. In fact, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a case of less is more.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s strive to make fantastic creators&#x27; lives easier when it comes to making the things we love... not wiping them out altogether. I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be saying this repeatedly, for many years to come, until I&#x27;m blue in the face.</p>
<p>Will AI Take My Job? Dispatches can be streamed on Channel 4 now in the UK, while international viewers needing a VPN to do so.</p>

<h2>Notorious Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon found lurking in European comms networks</h2>

<p>Salt Typhoon strikes again - but this time unsuccessfully</p>
<p>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here&#x27;s how it works.</p>
<p>Notorious Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon has been once again linked to intrusions against telecommunications firms - this time in Europe.</p>
<p>A new report from Darktrace claims the group has been observed, &quot;targeting global infrastructure using stealthy techniques such as DLL sideloading and zero-day exploits.&quot;</p>
<p>The early stage intrusion activity detected mirrors previous Salt Typhoon tactics, such as the prolific attacks on up to 8 different telecom organizations in a far reaching and potent multi-year campaign which resulted in the group stealing information from millions of American telecom customers using a high severity Cisco flaw to gain access and eventually collect traffic from the networks devices were connected to.</p>
<p>In the latest incident, Darktrace assessed with moderate confidence that Salt Typhoon abused legitimate tools with stealth and persistence - exploiting a Citrix NetScaler Gateway appliance to obtain initial access.</p>
<p>From there, the criminals deployed Snappybee malware, also known as Deed RAT, which is launched using a technique called DLL side-loading - another tactic commonly used by Chinese threat actors.</p>
<p>&quot;The backdoor was delivered to these internal endpoints as a DLL alongside legitimate executable files for antivirus software such as Norton Antivirus, Bkav Antivirus, and IObit Malware Fighter,&quot; Darktrace explained.</p>
<p>&quot;This pattern of activity indicates that the attacker relied on DLL side-loading via legitimate antivirus software to execute their payloads. Salt Typhoon and similar groups have a history of employing this technique, enabling them to execute payloads under the guise of trusted software and bypassing traditional security controls.&quot;</p>

<p>Darktrace says the intrusion was identified and remediated before it could escalate beyond the early stages of attack - neutralizing the threat.</p>
<p>This highlights the vital importance of proactive, anomaly-based defense and detection above the more traditional signature-based methods, especially given the rise in persistent, state sponsored threat actors.</p>

<p>The cable-free, natural-looking digital display your walls need</p>
<p>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here&#x27;s how it works.</p>
<p>Aura just branched out from making the best digital photo frames such as its Walden, to a completely new and power-efficient color e-paper type - the Aura Ink.</p>
<p>Announced and available from today for $499 at Aura Frames (UK and Australia pricing TBC), the Aura Ink is able to run for three months on a single charge, which means you can ditch ugly cables for a clean display on your wall or sideboard.</p>
<p>The E Ink Spectra™ 6 six-color display can render millions of tones for life-like color photos, with what Aura says is the &#x27;warmth and subtleness of a printed photograph&#x27;.</p>
<p>A first for Aura, the Ink e-paper frame has a 13.3-inch display that&#x27;s just 0.6-inches thick and is surrounded by a generous and attractive mount and frame.</p>
<p>Ink is supported by Aura&#x27;s superb subscription-free app for remote image uploads. Having tested many digital photo frames, I can say that Aura&#x27;s is one of the easiest apps to use.</p>
<p>Aura says it has advanced e-paper tech in the Ink with richer color and smarter lighting, which overcome the pitfalls of e-paper displays, namely images otherwise appearing dim.</p>
<p>Aura&#x27;s dithering approach expands the six-color system into a vast number of tones, which are further boosted in contrast by a subtle built-in front light.</p>
<p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p>
<p>The result is a natural and bright paper-like display that gives off the feeling of a printed image, without the glaring glow of a standard digital photo frame.</p>
<p>And unlike digital photo frames, the Aura Ink is extremely power efficient - it&#x27;ll run for up to three months on a full charge, so it can be placed without ugly trailing cables.</p>
<p>I already have my hands on the Aura Ink - it&#x27;s certainly a high-end frame. Check back in soon for my full review for a classy frame that looks set to trouble our best digital photo frames guide.</p>

<p>Sony has released a brand new PlayStation 5 Pro, featuring several slight improvements from the original console, confirming rumors that the new model won&#x27;t feature any major changes.</p>
<p>The details come from YouTuber Austin Evans(via PlayStationLifestyle), who got his hands on a new model and has conducted a thorough test to compare the latest console to the original.</p>
<p>While it appears from the outside that there are no major upgrades that would warrant you to trade in your old model, there are some slight differences that are worth noting.</p>
<p>For instance, the new PS5 Pro is lighter, coming in a 3016 grams, which is an 87 gram difference compared to the original&#x27;s 3103 grams and mainly due to the changes made to the console&#x27;s internal hardware components, specifically the motherboard, fan, and power supply.</p>
<p>On top of the console sounding quieter and running slightly cooler, it&#x27;s also confirmed that the new model is between 2% and 3% more energy efficient than its original, as per the rumors. However, when tested against games like Astro&#x27;s Playroom and Gran Turismo 7, Evans found a small improvement of 3% to 4%.</p>
<p>Another rumor also claimed that the new PS5 Pro will launch alongside a new DualSense wireless controller, which was said to feature a removable battery.</p>
<p>While the new console does come with the revised pad, with slight differences, it doesn&#x27;t come with the removable battery component.</p>

<p>Those changes include a new model number, an additional support component under the shell, the removal of one of the built-in microphones on the back, and not much else.</p>
