<p>The government has published its new white paper, and there&#x27;s big news in it for students going to university or college.</p>
<p>We now know both tuition fees and maintenance loans for university students will increase with inflation every year from 2026.</p>
<p>And for students finishing their GCSEs, new courses called V-levels will be introduced alongside A-levels and T-levels.</p>
<p>Lots of you have sent in questions about how it&#x27;s all going to work. We answer them below.</p>
<p>We had this question via Your Voice Your BBC News.</p>
<p>The answer is yes. Tuition fees will rise from 2026 onwards, so we expect that those starting university in 2026 will have higher fees.</p>
<p>The exact amount students will be charged is unknown at the moment - as it depends on what the rate of inflation is.</p>
<p>The inflation measure used - the Retail Price Index minus mortgage payments, or RPIx - is likely to be the one used for next year&#x27;s and future increases.</p>
<p>If it was done at the current rate, fees would rise by approximately £400 a year, to over £9,900.</p>
<p>This is unclear and the situation is different for each university - though lots of them have experienced financial difficulties of some kind in recent years.</p>
<p>A professor from Coventry University who spoke to BBC News on Monday said it was a &quot;good thing&quot; that tuition fees were rising, but that &quot;under no circumstances will it solve the problem&quot; around university finances.</p>
<p>And the University and College Union has a lot to say on this too. General secretary Jo Grady accuses Labour of having &quot;doubled down on the disastrous tuition-fees funding model, which created the crisis the sector is currently facing&quot;.</p>
<p>She says the union wants to see &quot;proper public funding&quot; for higher education, and a resolution to the current dispute over &quot;low pay, vicious job cuts and poor working conditions, and the impact this has on students&#x27; learning experience&quot;.</p>
<p>Chief executive Vivienne Stern says raising fees in line with inflation will &quot;help to halt the long-term erosion of universities&#x27; financial sustainability, following a decade of fee freezes&quot;.</p>
<p>This is another question that came in through Your Voice Your BBC News.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Children paid &#x27;huge price&#x27; in Covid pandemic, Johnson tells inquiry</h2>

<p>Children paid a &quot;huge price&quot; to protect others during the Covid pandemic, Boris Johnson has told the inquiry looking at the impact on young people.</p>
<p>The former prime minister repeated an apology made previously for things the government got wrong, but said he was proud of what teachers and schools did to cope with the &quot;unbelievably difficult&quot; circumstances.</p>
<p>He pushed back on earlier suggestions that there had been no plans in place for closing schools in early 2020, saying he had assumed a &quot;great deal of thought and care&quot; was already going into those decisions by then.</p>
<p>But he said he had also hoped schools could remain open, calling it a &quot;nightmare idea&quot; and &quot;personal horror&quot; to close them.</p>
<p>Former education secretary Gavin Williamson gave his own evidence to the inquiry last week, in which he said the government had made an error in &quot;sticking to the plan&quot; of trying to keep schools open in March 2020.</p>
<p>The inquiry was told a plan was only made on 17 March 2020 - the day before an announcement that schools were closing.</p>
<p>Johnson told the inquiry on Tuesday that he accepted the criticism around the lack of planning, but added that making changes to schools would have required a &quot;much greater state of knowledge about Covid and what was likely to happen&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The speed at which the disease was progressing&quot; made it harder to plan around, he added, saying the key focus was on trying to avoid an &quot;appalling public health crisis&quot;.</p>
<p>The inquiry has also heard previously about several disagreements between Williamson and Johnson, including over the decision to close schools again in 2021.</p>
<p>Last week, Williamson was confronted with an expletive-laden message he had sent to the then-prime minister in February 2021, in which he said he had taken &quot;abuse&quot; for the government&#x27;s decision to shut schools one day after they reopened.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Johnson told the inquiry he had wanted to see &quot;mass testing&quot; in schools as a way of keeping them open.</p>
<p>But that was &quot;never going to be a runner&quot; because of the new alpha variant which arrived at the same time and accelerated the spread of the disease, he said.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues of the pandemic for both Johnson and Williamson came in the exam results fiasco of August 2020.</p>
<p>The public outcry led to a U-turn which meant pupils were ultimately awarded the grades they had been predicted by their teachers, after GCSE and A-level exams were scrapped earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Johnson was confronted with his own leaked messages at the inquiry on Tuesday, in which he had told advisers Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain at the time that the DfE needed &quot;better ministers&quot;.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>University tuition fees in England to rise with inflation every year from 2026</h2>
<p><em>BBC Education - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkzj87n8rdo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_0f9a45827a5e.webp'></p>
<p>University tuition fees in England will increase every year in line with inflation from 2026 onwards, the government has announced.</p>
<p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson confirmed the increase for the next two years, and promised legislation which would make it happen automatically every year after that.</p>
<p>Maintenance loans will also increase yearly in line with inflation.</p>
<p>Speaking in Parliament, Phillipson said &quot;charging full fees will be conditional on high quality teaching&quot;, and that only those universities providing strong outcomes for students would be able to charge the maximum fees.</p>
<p>Universities which fall below the quality threshold set by the regulator in England, the Office for Students, will not be able to charge the new maximum and risk having a cap imposed on the number of students they can recruit.</p>
<p>Tuition fees in England this academic year are £9,535, having increased for the first time in more than a decade last year.</p>
<p>The inflation measure used - the Retail Price Index minus mortgage payments, or RPIx - is likely to be the one used for future increases.</p>
<p>That inflation rate is likely to fluctuate before next year&#x27;s increase, so it is not yet clear what fees students starting university in 2026 will be charged. If it was done at the current rate, fees would rise by approximately £400 a year, to over £9,900.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes clear that universities are a huge national asset, rightly admired around the world. We need them to be in great shape if we want national renewal,&quot; chief executive Vivienne Stern said.</p>
<p>Raising fees in line with inflation will &quot;help to halt the long-term erosion of universities&#x27; financial sustainability, following a decade of fee freezes&quot;, she added.</p>
<p>But University and College Union general secretary Jo Grady said the government had &quot;doubled down on the disastrous tuition-fees funding model, which created the crisis the sector is currently facing&quot;.</p>
<p>The union published analysis earlier this month which suggested universities had collectively announced more than 12,000 job cuts in the last year.</p>
<p>Prof Ian Dunn, provost at Coventry University, said the proposed increases were a &quot;good thing&quot; for universities, but added that &quot;under no circumstances will this solve the problem&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;From a university perspective, it adds a little income and will alleviate a little of the pressure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it will not in itself solve the financial situation universities are in right now.&quot;</p>

<div class='article'><h2>New V-level courses to be brought in for students after GCSEs</h2>
<p><em>BBC Education - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzjp5n5kro?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_6dba2a10d17e.webp'></p>
<p>New vocational courses called V-levels will be rolled out for 16-year-olds under government plans to simplify a &quot;confusing landscape&quot; of qualifications in England.</p>
<p>They are set to replace Level 3 BTecs and other post-16 technical qualifications.</p>
<p>Ministers also plan to reduce the number of teenagers resitting maths and English GCSEs by introducing a new &quot;stepping stone&quot; qualification.</p>
<p>The Sixth Form Colleges Association warned that V-levels may not fill the gap left by BTecs.</p>
<p>Ministers are expected to lay out proposals for higher education funding, including university tuition fees, on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>The government has launched a consultation on its V-level plans, which form part of its post-16 education and skills white paper.</p>
<p>They come after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stressed the importance of vocational training, announcing a target for two-thirds of young people to go to university or study a technical qualification.</p>
<p>Lola Marshall, 17, hopes to do an apprenticeship after her health and social care extended diploma at Leeds City College, and said there wasn&#x27;t enough discussion about vocational routes at school.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone always talked about university and no one ever really helped me decide whether I wanted to do university or an apprenticeship,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear when V-levels will be introduced, how they will be rolled out, or which subjects will be on offer - although the Department for Education (DfE) gave craft and design and media, broadcast and production as examples.</p>
<p>Skills minister Baroness Jacqui Smith said V-levels aimed to simplify options for students.</p>
<p>&quot;There are over 900 courses at the moment that young people have the choice of, and it&#x27;s confusing,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;[V-levels] will build on what&#x27;s good about BTecs and other alternative qualifications - the ability to be able to work practically, the concentration on things that are going to lead to employment.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the new courses would simplify a &quot;fragmented&quot; and &quot;confusing&quot; system for young people, while giving them a &quot;vocational route into great careers&quot;.</p>
<p>The government was boosting investment in further education, she added, in order to ensure there are enough teachers to deliver them.</p>

<div class='article'><h2>Why medical students are choosing Bulgaria over UK</h2>
<p><em>BBC Education - <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgz8g8jg48o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss'>Original</a> - None</em></p>
<p><img src='article_images/preview_7704d583f0ea.webp'></p>
<p>A growing number of young people are choosing to study in Eastern Europe due to a strict cap on medical school places in the UK.</p>
<p>Freya Mandapalli from Preston is one of them.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old has healthcare in her blood. Her parents both work at the local hospital and her older sister studied medicine at Edinburgh and now works as a doctor.</p>
<p>&quot;I just got inspired by her really,&quot; Freya said.</p>
<p>But getting into a medical school in the UK generally requires a minimum of three As at A-level and high grades in other subjects and Freya struggled to get them.</p>
<p>She considered a gap year but then a family friend mentioned the possibility of studying in Plovdiv, in Southern Bulgaria.</p>
<p>&quot;I was really nervous to start with, but the city&#x27;s beautiful and I&#x27;ve found some great friends,&quot; added Freya, who has just started her second year of a medical degree.</p>
<p>In England around 8,126 medical students started this academic year, just over a thousand of them in the North West.</p>
<p>This is sharply up from two years ago when it was just 7,010 but still far short of the 15,000 the government says it needs for England by 2031 to meet demand.</p>
<p>But with the cap on medical school places, it means competition to get one is intense, and many students are voting with their feet.</p>
<p>Mohammed Adnaan Patel from Bolton has just started his fifth year at the same university in Plovdiv. He too found the course through word of mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;One of my friends told me that his brother already studies within Bulgaria and he was planning on going himself,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;My mother was very worried, my father wanted me to stay strong and be independent, but the rest of my family didn&#x27;t know what to expect. But those worries gradually subsided.&quot;</p>
<p>The Medical University of Plovdiv is one of Bulgaria&#x27;s most prestigious medical schools and attracts many more applicants than it admits. Although it does ask for academic qualifications, a large part of the admissions process hangs on an entrance exam.</p>
<p>That may be in part because classes for international students are held in English but also because a well-established network of agencies now exist to help those hoping to make the leap.</p>
